Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron's strong competitive position
and solid execution delivered record revenue in ﬁscal Q3 with revenue, gross margin
and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges.
Data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year and reached a record level,
and consumer-oriented markets had strong sequential growth. W e generated
substantial free cash ﬂow in the quarter , even as we continue to make strategic
investments critical to sustain long-term growth. I'm thankful to all our Micron team
members for their focus and execution, which made these results possible.
In ﬁscal Q3, DRAM revenue reached a new record driven by a nearly 50% sequential
growth in HBM revenue. W e remain the sole supplier in volume production of
LPDRAM in the data center . In NAND, we achieved a new quarterly record for
market share across data center SSDs as well as client SSDs in calendar Q1. For
the ﬁrst time ever , during calendar Q1, Micron has become the #2 brand by share in
data center SSDs according to third-party data. Looking ahead to ﬁscal Q4, we see a
robust demand environment and expect to grow revenue by 15% sequentially to a
record $10.7 billion at guidance midpoint.
In June, we have completed a strategic reorganization of our business units around
key market segments to capitalize on the tremendous AI growth opportunity ahead.
As high-performance memory and storage becomes increasingly critical to enabling
AI- driven innovation, this new structure enhances Micron's ability to engage more
deeply with customers by shifting more resources to AI-focused opportunities across
our portfolio. W e are making excellent progress on our 1-gamma DRAM technology
node with yields ramping ahead of the record pace we have achieved on our 1-beta
node.
We completed several key product milestones during the quarter , including the ﬁrst
qualiﬁcation sample shipments of 1-gamma based LP5 DRAM. Micron 1-gamma
DRAM leverages EUV , and the node provides a 30% improvement in bit density ,
more than 20% lower power and up to 15% higher performance compared to 1-beta
DRAM. W e will leverage 1-gamma across our entire DRAM product portfolio to
beneﬁt from this leadership technology . In NAND, we reached a record-high mix of
QLC bits in the quarter . We
started qualiﬁcations for new high-performance SSD products based on our G9 2-
terabit QLC NAND, and we continue to ramp our G9 node at a pace consistent with
demand.
We are making disciplined investments in our global operations network to add to
supply in line with demand over time. Two weeks ago, with support from the Trump
administration, Micron announced plans to invest approximately $200 billion in the
U.S., which includes $150 billion in manufacturing and $50 billion in R&D over the
next 20-plus years. As part of this $200 billion investment plan, Micron plans to invest
an additional $30 billion beyond previously announced plans, which includes building
a second leading- edge memory fab in Boise, Idaho; expanding and modernizing our
existing fab in Manassas, V irginia, serving the automotive, aerospace, defense and
industrial markets; and bringing advanced packaging capabilities to the U.S. to
support our long-term HBM growth plans after we have established sufﬁcient DRAM
wafer scale in our U.S. operations.
We are pleased with the strong endorsement we received for our technology ,
products and investment plans from our customers and ecosystem partners as part
of this announcement. Our ﬁrst Idaho fab, ID1, achieved another key construction
milestone in June. W e expect ﬁrst DRAM wafer output at ID1 to begin in the second
half of calendar 2027 with customer qualiﬁcations to follow . The second Idaho fab,
ID2, will beneﬁt from manufacturing economies of scale with ID1 and adds to R&D
co-location beneﬁts with greater efﬁciencies and faster time to market. To meet
anticipated demand, ID2 will begin production before the ﬁrst New York fab. W e
expect to begin ground preparation in New York later this year following the
completion of state and federal environmental reviews.
Turning to our end markets. In data center , we expect the CY25 server market to
grow mid-single digits percentage in units, largely driven by signiﬁcant growth in AI
servers. In ﬁscal Q3, data center DRAM revenue reached a new record for the fourth
consecutive quarter , driven by strong growth and share gains in HBM and robust
performance by our industry-leading portfolio of high-capacity DIMMs and low-power
server DRAM products.
We are executing well on our HBM ramp and product development road map. Our
yield and volume ramp on HBM3E 12-high is progressing extremely well, and we
expect shipment crossover in FQ4. W e expect to reach HBM shares similar to our
overall DRAM share sometime in the second half of calendar 2025.
At AMD's Advancing AI event earlier this month, we announced that Micron's HBM3E
36-gigabyte 12-high has been designed into AMD's Instinct MI355X GPU platform.
We are now shipping HBM in high volume to 4 customers, spanning both GPU and
ASIC platforms.
As generative AI workloads grow in size and complexity , the performance demands
on HBM continue to rise. Micron's HBM4 leverages our well-established 1-beta
DRAM technology along with an internally developed and manufactured advanced
CMOS logic base die to deliver bandwidth exceeding 2 terabytes per second per
memory stack, over 60% higher performance than the previous generation.
Additionally , Micron's HBM4 of fers a 20% lower power consumption compared to the
already industry-leading power performance on our HBM3E 12-high product, setting
new benchmarks in power efﬁciency for this product category . The expanded
interface for HBM4 facilitates rapid communication and a high throughput design that
accelerates the inference performance of large language models and chain of
thought reasoning systems. Micron has delivered samples of HBM4 to multiple
customers and expect to ramp volume production in calendar 2026, aligned with our
customers' plans.
We are exceptionally well positioned for the ramp of HBM4. Building on the success
of our HBM3E ramp, we have high-quality , ﬁeld-proven technology and have
executed a robust and signiﬁcant ramp in our HBM manufacturing capacity . We have
deep relationships with practically every major customer of HBM and have earned
their trust with our execution, delivering the world's lowest-power , highest-
performance HBM.
Our portfolio of high-capacity DIMMs and low-power server DRAM solutions
delivered another record revenue quarter . Micron has pioneered the adoption of
LPDRAM for servers, and we continue to maintain our sole-source position for LP  in
server . Together , our high-capacity DIMM and LP  server products have already
generated multiple billions of dollars in revenue in ﬁscal 2025, reﬂecting a
remarkable ﬁvefold growth compared to the same period in the previous year .
During calendar Q1, for the third consecutive quarter , Micron achieved a record for
data center SSD market share driven by our portfolio of dif ferentiated products
enabled through vertical integration. In ﬁscal Q3, our data center 9550 performance
SSD, which is on the NVIDIA  GB200 NVL72 recommended vendor list, completed
additional customer qualiﬁcations at multiple OEMs. Micron's 9550 SSDs provide an
industry-leading performance and energy-efﬁcient Gen5 data center storage solution
for AI server systems. W e continue to qualify additional customers and ramp revenue
for our 6550 ION 60-terabyte capacity SSDs.
Turning to PC. W e expect PC market units to grow in the low single-digit percentage
range in calendar 2025. In the quarters ahead, key catalysts for growth include the
increasing adoption of AI-enabled PCs and the Windows 1 1 upgrade cycle.
Micron is focused on bringing dif ferentiated high-performance products to the PC
market. Our strong SSD portfolio resulted in Micron achieving a record-high client
SSD market share in calendar Q1. Tomorrow , we will be announcing our new G9
QLC 2- terabyte based SSD featuring our proprietary Adaptive W rite Technology ,
which enables 4x faster write performance. This technology expands the
addressable market for QLC SSDs by delivering performance equivalent to TLC
NAND for most consumer use cases.
Turning to mobile. W e expect smartphone units to grow low single digits in calendar
2025. AI adoption remains a key driver of DRAM content growth for smartphones,
and we expect more smartphone launches featuring 12 gigabytes or more compared
to 8 gigabytes of capacity in the average smartphone today . Micron is focused on
providing solutions to the high-end smartphone segments, leveraging our leading 1-
beta and 1-gamma technology nodes for LP5X DRAM and G8 and G9 technology
nodes for our UFS 4 NAND products.
During the quarter , we began shipping qualiﬁcation samples of the industry's ﬁrst
LP5X memory built on the 1-gamma node, of fering a wide range of capacities and
industry-leading speed grades for 2026 ﬂagship smartphones. Micron's 1-gamma
LP5X DRAM is engineered to accelerate AI applications in high-end devices,
delivering over 25% faster recommendations across several use cases while
reducing power consumption by 20%, all in an ultrathin form factor ideal for mobile.
In NAND, we secured a key customer design win and ramped high-volume
production of our G9-based UFS 4 products. The strength of our mobile portfolio was
further recognized through top quality awards from 7 smartphone OEMs during the
quarter .
Turning to automotive, industrial and consumer embedded markets. W e expect
increasing adoption of L2 and L3 ADAS features, and AI-enabled in-vehicle
infotainment systems to drive memory and storage content growth as well as higher
bandwidth requirements. Micron is positioned for long-term success in the
automotive market with new product introductions such as the industry's ﬁrst 1-beta
dual-channel LP5 DRAM with high-speed 9.6 gigabits per second support, which
achieved production readiness during the quarter . In industrial, we are seeing a
resumption in our growth as customers increase their investments for the adoption of
AI, including in key areas like factory automation. Micron is driving price
improvements with a market backdrop of constrained D4 and LP4 supply and low
distributor channel inventory .
Now turning to our market outlook. Customer inventory levels have been healthy
overall across end markets, and there may have been some tarif f-related pull-ins by
certain customers. Our customers continue to signal a constructive demand
environment for the remainder of this calendar year , and we remain agile to adjust to
any unforeseen demand changes that may occur due to macro conditions or the
evolving tarif f-related situation.
We expect CY  '25 industry DRAM bit demand growth to be in the high teens
percentage range and industry NAND bit demand growth to be in the low double-digit
percentage range. W e expect Micron's bit supply growth to be below industry bit
demand growth for non-HBM DRAM and NAND. Over the medium term, we
anticipate industry bit demand growth of mid-teens CAGR for both DRAM and
NAND.
As previously communicated, our efﬁcient node conversions will result in 10%
structurally lower NAND wafer capacity ending ﬁscal 2025 versus the end of ﬁscal
2024 levels. Additionally , given NAND technology transitions provide a signiﬁcant
increase in overall bit output, Micron plans to manage our node conversions at a
measured pace, consistent with our demand.
Recent press reports have discussed the end of life of D4 and LP4 products.
Micron's leading-edge DRAM nodes such as 1-beta and 1- gamma are focused on
the latest-generation products such as D5, LP5 and HBM and are not utilized to
produce D4 and LP4. D4 and LP4 products are largely produced in our 1-alpha
DRAM node. Micron has sent EOL  notices for these products to customers in high-
volume segments like mobile, client, data center and consumer several months ago
with ﬁnal shipments occurring in 2 to 3 quarters from now .
This EOL  process is similar to prior transitions from one generation of memory to
another , and consistent with history , Micron intends to support its longevity
customers with long-term and relatively lower-volume requirements in segments like
automotive, industrial, defense and networking with supply of these 1-alpha DRAM
products for several years. In the near term, customers in the high- volume segments
are starting to see increasing shortages of D4 products. W e are now on allocation for
these products and are working with customers to try and support their high-priority
near-term demand. D4 revenues are low single-digit percentage of our revenues in
second half of ﬁscal 2025. W e anticipate LP4 shortages may also increase as a
result of EOL.
In closing, Micron's record Q3 revenue performance and strong Q4 outlook are the
results of our strategic focus and consistent execution. As AI drives unprecedented
demand for high-performance memory and storage, Micron is exceptionally well
positioned to capitalize on this transformative era. Our leadership in technology ,
highlighted by progress in HBM, 1-gamma DRAM and G9
NAND, alongside disciplined global manufacturing investments, supports our path to
sustained growth. W e are conﬁdent that our strategic direction, innovation
capabilities and the execution by our exceptional team will continue to create
meaningful value for our shareholders, customers and employees. W e are on track
to deliver record revenue with solid proﬁtability and free cash ﬂow in ﬁscal year '25,
while we invest to build on our leadership to addressing growing AI-driven memory
demand.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark J. Murphy
Thank you, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in
ﬁscal Q3 with revenue, gross margin and EPS all above the high end of the guidance
ranges provided in our last earnings call.
Total ﬁscal Q3 revenue was $9.3 billion, up 15% sequentially and up 37% year-over-
year and a quarterly revenue record for Micron. Higher sequential revenue was
driven by growth across our end markets, including record data center revenues and
strong sequential growth in consumer-oriented markets. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue
was $7.1 billion, up 51% year-over-year and represented 76% of total revenue.
Sequentially , DRAM revenue increased 15% with bit shipments increasing over 20%
and prices decreasing in the low single-digit percentage range, primarily due to a
higher consumer-oriented revenue mix. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $2.2 billion,
up 4% year-over-year and represented 23% of Micron's total revenue. Sequentially ,
NAND revenue increased 16% with bit shipments increasing in the mid-20s
percentage range and prices decreasing in the high single-digit percentage range.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $5.1 billion, up 1 1% sequentially and a quarterly record. This
performance was driven by a nearly 50% sequential increase in HBM along with
growth in our high-capacity DRAM and low-power server DRAM. Revenue for the
Storage Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 4% sequentially . This growth was
primarily driven by an increase in consumer-oriented revenue. Mobile Business Unit
revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% sequentially . Sequential revenue growth was due
to reduced customer inventories and strong demand from DRAM content growth.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20% sequentially , supported
by growth in industrial and consumer embedded markets.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q3 was 39%, up 1 10 basis points
sequentially and up 250 basis points versus the midpoint of our guidance. Gross
margins were above the high end of our guidance range, primarily due to better
prices for both DRAM and NAND, partially of fset by a higher consumer-oriented mix.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q3 were $1.1 billion, up $87 million quarter-over-quarter
and in line with our guidance range. The increase was primarily driven by higher
R&D investments and labor-related costs. W e generated operating income of $2.5
billion in ﬁscal Q3, resulting in an operating margin of 26.8%, up approximately 190
basis points sequentially and up 13 percentage points year- over-year .
Fiscal Q3 taxes were $306 million on an ef fective tax rate of 12.3%, lower than our
guidance due to the ef fects of onetime discrete items in the quarter . Non-GAAP
diluted earnings per share in ﬁscal Q3 was $1.91, above the high end of the
guidance range with 22% sequential growth and up over 200% versus the year ago
quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. In ﬁscal Q3, our operating cash ﬂows
were over $4.6 billion, and our capital expenditures were $2.7 billion. Free cash ﬂows
in the quarter were over $1.9 billion, the highest quarterly amount in over 6 years.
Ending inventory for ﬁscal Q3 was $8.7 billion or 139 days. Inventory was down $280
million sequentially , and inventory days were down 19 days sequentially , driven by
strong sequential bit shipment growth in both DRAM and NAND.
On the balance sheet, we held a record $12.2 billion of cash and investments at
quarter end and maintained $15.7 billion of liquidity when including our untapped
credit facility . During ﬁscal Q3, we reﬁnanced our $900 million 2027 notes with $1.7
billion in new notes maturing in ﬁscal years 2033 and 2036. W e closed the quarter
with $15.5 billion of debt, maintaining low net leverage and a weighted average debt
maturity of 2032.
Now turning to our outlook for the fourth ﬁscal quarter . We expect our revenue
growth to be weighted towards DRAM, supported by robust pricing execution,
favorable product mix and continued cost improvements, all of which beneﬁt gross
margins. Operating expenses for ﬁscal Q4 are projected to be approximately $1.2
billion with the sequential increase primarily driven by planned R&D investments in
future technology nodes and HBM product development.
Our ﬁscal 2025 capital spending plans remain unchanged at approximately $14
billion. The overwhelming majority of the ﬁscal 2025 CapEx is to support HBM as
well as facility , construction, back-end manufacturing and R&D investments. W e
expect a ﬁscal Q4 tax
rate of around 13%. As previously disclosed, our ﬁscal 2026 tax rate is expected to
be in the high teens percentage range following Singapore's adoption of the global
minimum tax. Any impacts that occur due to potential new tarif fs are not included in
our guidance.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q4 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $10.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million; gross margin to be in
the range of 42%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.2 billion, plus or minus $20 million. W e expect our ﬁscal Q4 tax rate
to be around 13%. Based on a share count of approximately 1.15 billion shares, we
expect EPS to be $2.50 per share, plus or minus $0.15.
With another quarter of shipment growth forecasted in ﬁscal Q4, we expect to exit
ﬁscal 2025 with tight DRAM inventories, signiﬁcantly reduced NAND inventories and
overall company DIO near our target levels. With low inventories on hand and a
constructive demand environment, we will continue to focus on improving pricing and
further strengthening our product mix.
In ﬁscal Q3, Micron delivered earnings above the guidance range, achieved record
revenue and continued ramping our industry- leading HBM. W e also began
transitioning to a new market segment-focused business unit structure. Starting in
ﬁscal Q4, we will report revenue, gross margin and operating margin metrics across
these new business units. With strong execution and a dif ferentiated product
portfolio, Micron is well positioned to maintain our leadership and to deliver record
revenue and signiﬁcantly improved proﬁtability once again in ﬁscal Q4. Thank you for
joining us today . We will now open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri
from UBS.
Timothy Michael Arcuri
Sanjay , I wanted to ask sort of how you see the HBM TAM scaling with the
accelerator TAM. One thing that's been clear over the past 3 months or so is that the
accelerated TAM is deﬁnitely upsiding and growing a lot. And it seems -- if I take their
projections and I take your HBM projections, it kind of seems like the HBM market is
going to remain 15% to 20% of what the overall accelerator market is. I guess, how
do you see the HBM TAM scaling with that market? And then is there some sort of
limit or like asymptote that we begin to reach in terms of HBM attached to these
GPUs and these custom ASICs?
Sanjay Mehrotra
With respect to HBM growth, we certainly see that HBM demand grows in the future.
I'll tell you that in this year , if you look at calendar year '25, HBM is growing from last
year about $18 billion in revenue to approximately $35 billion in calendar year '25.
We see in calendar year '26, if you look at HBM bit demand growth, it will
signiﬁcantly exceed the overall DRAM industry demand growth. And of course, the
transition from 8-high to 12-high in HBM in '26, transition to HBM4 as well, which is
even a higher-value product, all of that essentially bodes well in terms of the value of
HBM and the overall need for HBM in these accelerator platforms that are, of course,
evolving fast.
And of course, our customers are very much focused on working with us and looking
at their platforms, assessing the mix of 12- high and HBM4. And then when we look
at '27, that goes into HBM4E. '28 starts introducing customization in HBM as well. So
the trajectory of HBM in terms of the value proposition in these accelerators
continues to be strong and healthy . And of course, we are well positioned. W e -- as
we shared with you, we have already begun to sample our HBM4 products. And
these -- again, we plan to maintain our leadership with respect to speciﬁcations here,
and we have certainly demonstrated a capacity ramp-up as well. So we remain
excited about HBM. W e see this as clearly a strong growth driver as well as value
driver for our business.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of V ivek Arya from Bank of America
Securities.
Vivek Arya
I wanted to talk about gross margins. So ﬁrst, what is driving the upside sequentially?
And then is this the new baseline for gross margins? And then what would be kind of
the puts and takes as we look at the next few quarters beyond Q4?
Mark J. Murphy
Yes. V ivek, it's Mark. So in the third quarter , I think maybe start with what happened
in gross margin in the third quarter . We had a strong sequential volume growth in the
quarter . But versus the guide, the deﬁning factor was we had -- prices were down, as
I said in the opening comments, but we had better-than-expected pricing that drove
the margin improvement versus expectations. I'll add, too, that we had good cost
performance and all. But certainly , the price was better than we had expected.
Now that carries on into rebaselining on the fourth quarter . So we provided an
indication of the fourth quarter before when the market was in transition, and we said
at that time that the inventory outlook that we would -- was improving when it
weakened a bit late last year . And we had intended to work to inﬂect price. And as
you know , a few weeks later , the situation with the Liberation Day tarif fs, the
environment got a bit more challenging.
The condition of the market is better than expected since then, and it strengthened
through the quarter . You saw that outperformance. And then we've executed well.
And so what you see here from this rebaseline of the business, you see us add to
that through favorable mix Q3 to Q4. That's more DRAM growth than NAND, so you
have favorable mix there, and then more data center than consumer- oriented mix,
which was weighing down the margins in the third quarter .
So yes, so it's -- again, it's a continued good market backdrop. W e're going to
continue to focus on pricing. But third quarter to fourth quarter , we have favorable
mix ef fects that is helping drive margins up to the current guide of 42%.
Vivek Arya
And anything beyond this mark? Any puts and takes as we look at the next several
quarters? Is this kind of the new baseline? Or is it going to be entirely dependent on
the direction of pricing?
Mark J. Murphy
Yes. W e're not going to provide Q1 guidance. W e are positive on the trajectory of the
business. The market environment does remain constructive, particularly in DRAM
versus NAND. Again, we're focused on pricing and making sure to put our bets in the
right places. As we said in the prepared remarks, our inventories are very tight,
particularly on leading edge and then now even pockets of some of the legacy and
DRAM. So we're going to have some bit constraints going into ﬁrst quarter , but we're
going to mix to DRAM, higher- value DRAM and higher-value NAND products. And
so we think gross margins can be up.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.
Christopher James Muse
I was hoping to revisit your comments on HBM. So you're talking 23%, 24% market
share. And it sounds like you're now calling not exiting the year but sometime in the
second half. So that's coming in better . And so I guess ﬁrst question is, should we be
thinking that, that number is kind of a 22%, 23% depending, I guess, on seasonality
of the $35 billion number? And then perhaps more importantly , as you think about
HBM growth in calendar '26, how should we be thinking about the contributions to
that growth, both from bits as well as higher ASPs as you go to next-generation
products?
Sanjay Mehrotra
C.J., I didn't quite understand the question around 22%, 23%. What exactly did you
say there?
Christopher James Muse
Just trying to understand how you talked about getting to your DRAM market share,
which I think you said 23%, 24% for the HBM market. And your previous comments
were exiting the year . Now you're saying sometime in the second half. So trying to
get an idea of kind of what that revenue number looks like.
Sanjay Mehrotra
We are already at -- if you look at our performance based on FQ3, we are already at
more than $6 billion run rate here with our HBM and certainly continuing to ramp up
our HBM output, shifting production to 12-high HBM as well. So yes, it could be that
compared to what we said before in terms of toward the end of the calendar year , we
expect to get to our HBM share in line with our DRAM share. So versus that, it could
be that we do end up getting to our industry share for -- in line with industry share for
HBM share earlier than that. So it could be. And that's really absolutely based on our
very, very strong execution and strong execution in terms of output, in terms of yield
ramp.
We noted that our 12-high yield ramp is actually going faster than our 8-high yield
ramp, of course, built on all the learning that we have had. The team has done an
excellent job with capacity ramp as well. All of that is contributing to our strong
performance on HBM. Extremely pleased with where we are and extremely pleased
with not just execution today and our ability to ramp up yield and capacity
successfully and built in the process trust with the customers, but very pleased with
the road map that is ahead for us for HBM as well. So I mean these are things that
will obviously play an important role in calendar year '26 as we work closely with the
customers to understand their overall mix requirements for 2026.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from Barclays.
Thomas James O'Malley
Two here. So my ﬁrst on the HBM side, you're obviously reaching your share target a
little bit earlier . Going into next year , are you guys ready to talk about what you think
that your normalized share will be? Obviously , there's difﬁculties with some of your
competitors getting qualiﬁed. If that continues into next year , do you guys have a
view of if you're able to increase capacity , and if you are, what that share may look
like?
And then two, on the NAND side, where does utilization stand today? And obviously ,
you're going through some of the transitions right now internally , which has allowed
you to kind of keep some things ofﬂine. But as you move into next year , what is your
plan for utilization? Is that going to be market dependent? Or at some point, do you
need to start bringing on utilization just from the fact that there's a gross margin
headwind?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So as I said, we are very pleased that we are executing well and with what we told
you several quarters ago in terms of our share objectives with HBM that we are
going to be able to achieve that goal for this year in second half of '26. Now our HBM
is really at scale. It has a healthy share and we are successfully delivering. So going
forward, of course, this becomes like part of our overall product portfolio and just like
we manage the rest of the portfolio with respect to total I on ROI and proﬁtability . And
of course, HBM really positions us very well with respect to our proﬁtability
objectives.
We will, of course, continue to manage the mix of our products in the portfolio,
including that of HBM, including the share that sometimes can move around in
different parts of the end market segments that we address. So I think that's how you
have to look at it. Overall, really very pleased with our HBM products, 12-high as well
as HBM4 built with our well-proven 1-beta technology , which also gives us cost-
effective beneﬁts. And of course, the packaging technology , well established. And
company , of course, has been investing in expanding our HBM back-end capacity as
well.
We have talked about investments in Singapore, bringing assembly and packaging
capacity there in line, starting production, targeting that for 2027 time frame. And I'll
tell you that HBM, given that it uses our well-proven 1-beta technology , is really
fungible capacity with the rest of the portfolio as well. So this gives us plenty of
ﬂexibility in terms of managing our business and extremely focused on really meeting
customers' requirements and continuing to deliver and enhance our product
capabilities to meet their growing requirements.
And your second question around NAND in terms of utilizations, so we have said
before that toward the end of ﬁscal '25, our NAND overall capacity would be down
versus end of ﬁscal '24 by about 10%. And that's a structural reduction in capacity .
And of course, as we have discussed before, that structural reduction was
implemented to achieve capital-efﬁcient next node transition for us like G9 node
transition. So as that capacity has come down, of course, our underutilization has
come down as well, although part of NAND continues to remain underutilized. I must
note here that, of course, leading edge of NAND is fully utilized.

And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan L. Sur
If I rewind back 1 year ago during your June earnings call, you guys did say back
then that you were sold out on your HBM supply through calendar '25 and that
majority of that committed supply was locked in from a pricing perspective. One year
later, where are you on your negotiations for your calendar '26 HBM supply and
pricing discussions? Is the team's supply outlook for next year fully committed, too?
Or maybe a better way to frame it, right, because I know that the HBM3E and HBM4
12-high qualiﬁcation cycles might be taken a bit longer , but maybe the other way to
frame it is, if you look at your customers' calendar '26 forecasted demand for HBM, is
it exceeding your forecasted supply capability?
Sanjay Mehrotra
With respect to HBM in 2025, yes, very pleased that what we told you back a year
ago, we are continuing to deliver on that, as I said earlier . And yes, our HBM is sold
out for 2025. And as I mentioned earlier , we are working closely with our customers
as
their platforms, AI accelerated platforms, both with GPUs as well as with ASICs, are
continuing to evolve and move fast. And they themselves are working on overall their
supply chain requirements and product mix with respect to HBM3E 12-high as well
as HBM4. So we continue to work with the customers in those, and we are still in the
middle of '25 and for 2026.
As I said earlier , we see, with respect to bit demand growth, strong trend in 2026, bit
demand growth for HBM signiﬁcantly exceeding DRAM demand growth. And of
course, we have a strong product road map. And we are working on continuing. As
we said, we sampled HBM4, focused on getting these products qualiﬁed with the
customers. And HBM3E 12-high is already in volume productions and doing very well
with our yield ramp there as well. So very much focused on addressing the '26 needs
for the customers and executing well and remaining extremely focused on our
execution for 2026.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley .
Joseph Lawrence Moore
I wonder if you could talk in terms of your long-term CapEx plans and the sort of 35%
of revenue levels. Is that kind of a reasonable guideline to think about for ﬁscal '26?
Or are you thinking because of the opportunity here you need to invest ahead of
that?
Mark J. Murphy
Yes. Joe, I mean we have a generational tech transition opportunity in front of us that
Micron is exceptionally well positioned for . And we've talked about inventory levels
for some time now , getting leaner , especially , being very tight on the leading edge.
And with the silicon requirements of HBM and with trade ratio, we need to build
greenﬁeld capacity . So that's underway . If you look at our CapEx forecast, we had a
little bit lower CapEx than we expected in the quarter at $2.7 billion, but you'll see by
the guide that we're going to see that CapEx increase in the fourth quarter . So we
stuck with our approximately $14 billion number .
I think as we go forward, we're continuing to build out the greenﬁeld capacity , and
there'll be equipment installs on the new nodes. There's grants involved and
construction. So the timing of that spend can be a bit lumpy . But we anticipate
generating free cash ﬂow in the fourth quarter . And you will see we'll just continue to
build our capacity .
I do want to note that we continue to make steps to improve the balance sheet
further in the quarter . We're down -- net debt now down to $3 billion. W e further
reduced maturities in the short end of the maturity schedule, taken out the $900
million '27 notes and issuing $1.75 billion further out. And we continue to be in a
great position with a ﬂexible balance sheet to invest in the business, make sure we
maintain technology leadership and then return capital to shareholders through
dividend and opportunistic buyback.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar
I had 2 questions for Sanjay -- or 2-part question. One is, when you look into HBM4,
given the double I/O count through silicon via, what kind of trade ratio should we
expect for HBM4? And also, when you look at -- broadly speaking, is there a
difference in HBM bits and margin proﬁle between selling to GPU versus ASIC
customers?
Sanjay Mehrotra
With respect to HBM4, its trade ratio is greater than 3. For HBM3E, previously , we
have shared that trade ratio is approximately 3, and HBM4 has a higher trade ratio
than 3. It has a larger die size. And of course, as you noted, it has a higher
performance. W e shared 60% higher performance given the high-bandwidth
interface that this has. And HBM4E will have a ratio that would be even greater . So
as we have shared with you in the past that as we are going from HBM3E to 4 to 4E,
the trade ratio is going from about 3 towards 4 in that time frame. So of course, this
puts -- HBM trade ratio and the growth of HBM absolutely puts a pressure on the
non-HBM supply in the industry as well.
And with respect to your question on the margin dif ference for GPU versus ASIC, of
course, HBM commands high value, whether it's in GPU accelerators or ASIC-based
accelerators. And that value proposition is only growing. When you look ahead over
the years, the
content with the future generation GPUs or ASIC platforms that will be out there of
HBM continues to -- is expected to continue to increase as well.
We have shared with you in the past that going from about 200 to 288 gigabytes in
GPU accelerators today as well as in the ASIC- based accelerators in that range
going to higher levels as we go from 8-high to 12-high capacity . So we don't -- so
value proposition is strong, both for GPU accelerators as well as ASIC accelerators.
And of course, we don't get into the speciﬁcs or dif ferentiating the 2 here.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from W olfe Research.
Christopher Caso
Just a clariﬁcation on one of the things you said in the prepared remarks. You talked
about there may have been some tarif f-related pull-ins by certain customers. I think
overall, your comments suggest that you -- at least my interpretation is that you think
that the customer inventory levels are getting a bit cleaned up here. Could you clarify
the remarks a little bit, put it in context of what you expect that means for customer
inventory levels and how that kind of af fects your view of bit demand in the second
half?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes. As we said, customer inventory levels have been healthy overall across our end
markets. Some customers may have some level of tarif f-related pull-ins. W e think the
impact of that is relatively modest here, and customers deﬁnitely continue to signal a
constructive demand environment for the remainder of the calendar year . And of
course, the demand trends are driven by strength in AI-driven data center demand,
demand coming back in the automotive, industrial, resumption of growth there as
well as distribution channels.
And as we have discussed, smartphone and PCs, really , as AI penetration increases,
the content increase story is there intact for AI smartphones as well as PC. W e
provided some details in our script there. So we see a constructive demand
environment as our customers discuss with us. And again, the ef fect of the pull-in is
relatively modest here. Our growth in Q3 as well as our exceptional record for FQ4
guidance is really driven by Micron's strong execution in the growing market for AI.
Operator
And our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line of V ijay Rakesh from Mizuho.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Just a quick question on the HBM4. Just wondering how the qualiﬁcation is
progressing and if you continue to see that similar power performance leadership
that you guys have had on HBM3E. Do you see that continuing on the HBM4 side as
well?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we have provided early units to our customers. W e have sampled the products to
our multiple customers with HBM4. Really very pleased with the execution and all the
specs that we see our HBM delivering, as I mentioned, not only performance, but we
plan to continue to focus on that power -- strong power position that we -- which is
critically important in AI applications that we have established with our HBM portfolio
as well. So of course, the qualiﬁcations -- the customer qualiﬁcations are ahead of
us, and we will be ready to meet customers' demand in 2026 time frame. So HBM in
terms of volume ramp is a 2026 product and meeting the time line requirements of
customers with their next-generation platforms that will be implementing the HBM4
products.
I want to again remind you that the HBM4 uses our well-proven, cost-ef fective, 1-
beta technology node. And of course, it has internal advanced CMOS logic die,
internally developed and internally manufactured advanced CMOS logic die, which
positions us well as well. And all of our experience of HBM3E ramp-up, we are going
from 3E 12-high to HBM3E -- going from -- sorry , going from HBM3E 8-high to
HBM3E 12-high, we told you that, that ramp is going extremely well with our yields
ahead of our plans, output ahead of our plans as well as yields faster than the ramp
that we had experienced in 8-high. All of that gives us conﬁdence and positions us
well for HBM4 ramp as well. So we feel very , very good about our overall capabilities
to address the HBM4 markets in 2026.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh
Got it. And on the SSD side, just quickly , with your focus on AI servers, are you
seeing an accelerated pull-through on the AI server side for SSDs as well?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we had mentioned on the data center side in SSDs in late Q4 of calendar '24 as
well as early part of calendar '25, there had been some inventory digestion for the
data center SSDs given that prior to this period that I just mentioned, there was a
very strong demand growth for SSDs. And as we look ahead, we think second half of
calendar '25 will be better than the ﬁrst half of '24 -- I mean, ﬁrst half of '25, which
was impacted by some of that inventory digestion as well.
And our data center SSDs are well positioned with some of these recently
announced accelerator platforms as well. And that, of course, will be contributing
towards the data center SSD future growth as well. W e are very pleased with our
record data center SSD share as achieved in CQ1 per the third-party reports. And we
are now a clear #2 brand in terms of market share at the end of CQ1. So we plan to
continue to leverage our SSD portfolio to continue to focus on shifting the mix of the
products towards higher-value parts of the NAND market.
