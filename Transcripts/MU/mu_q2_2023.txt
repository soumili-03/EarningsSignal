Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered ﬁscal second
quarter revenue within our guidance range, and excluding the impact of inventory
write-downs, margins and EPS were also within the guidance range. The
semiconductor memory and storage industry is facing its worst downturn in the last
13 years with an exceptionally weak pricing environment that is signiﬁcantly
impacting our ﬁnancial performance. W e have taken substantial supply reduction and
austerity measures, including executing a company-wide reduction in force.
We now believe that customer inventories have reduced in several end markets, and
we see gradually improving supply-demand balance in the months ahead. Excluding
the impact of inventory write-downs, we believe our balance sheet DIO has peaked
in ﬁscal Q2, and we are close to our transition to sequential revenue growth in our
quarterly results. W e are navigating the near-term difﬁcult environment with our
strong technology position, deep manufacturing expertise, strengthening product
portfolio, solid balance sheet and incredibly talented team. Beyond this downturn, we
anticipate a return to normalized growth and proﬁtability in line with our long-term
ﬁnancial model.
Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology . We are
investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing node
ramps to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. In DRAM, 1-alpha
represents most of our DRAM bit production, and we continue to make great
progress in initiating our transition to 1-beta. In NAND, 176-layer and 232-layer now
represent more than 90% of NAND bit production.
We also continue to lead the industry in QLC. QLC accounted for over 20% of our
NAND bit production and shipments in ﬁscal Q2. The Micron team's solid execution
and implementation of smart manufacturing has driven superb yield enhancement
across our leading-edge nodes. Yields on 1-alpha DRAM and 176-layer NAND have
reached levels that are now higher than any node in our history . In addition, both our
1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND have reached targeted yields ahead of schedule
and faster than any of our prior nodes.
We are well positioned to qualify these leading-edge nodes across our product
portfolio and will ramp them based on customer demand. W e are also making good
progress towards the introduction of our EUV -based 1-gamma node in 2025. Similar
to our 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, we expect this node to provide us with competitive
performance, power , cost and density improvements.
Now turning to our end markets. As a result of inventory adjustments across our end
markets, slowing demand growth and an extremely challenging pricing environment,
revenue was down year-over-year in all end markets.
While our industry faces signiﬁcant near-term challenges, we believe that the
memory and storage TAM will grow to a new record in calendar 2025 and will
continue to outpace the growth of the semiconductor industry thereafter . Recent
developments in AI provides an exciting prelude to the transformational capabilities
of large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT , which requires signiﬁcant
amounts of memory and storage to operate.
We are only in the very early stages of the void split deployment of these AI
technologies and potential exponential growth in their commercial use cases. As
more applications of this technology proliferate, we will see training workloads in the
data center supplemented with voice spread inﬂuence capabilities in the data center
as well as in end user devices, all of which will drive signiﬁcant growth in memory
and storage consumption.
In data center , we believe that our revenue bottomed in ﬁscal Q2, and we expect to
see revenue growth in ﬁscal Q3. Data center customer inventories should reach
relatively healthy levels by the end of calendar 2023.
We continue to see AI as a secular driver of demand growth in the data center . An AI
server today can have as much as 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and up
to 3x the NAND content. W e are well positioned to capture the memory and storage
opportunities that AI and data-centric computing architectures will provide. Our
product roadmap includes exciting HBM3 and CXL  innovations, and I look forward to
sharing more details about these solutions in the future. In ﬁscal Q2, we expanded
shipments of CXL  DRAM samples to OEM customers that service enterprise, cloud
and HPC workloads.
Micron is leading the industry with world-class DDR5, or D5 technology . We are
shipping D5 in high volume to data center customers and achieved our ﬁrst customer
qualiﬁcation for our 1-alpha 24-gigabit D5 product.
The latest generation of server processors, AMD's Genoa and Intel's Sapphire
Rapids, require D5 DRAM. Servers using these new processes will drive higher D5
industry bit demand in second half of calendar 2023, towards mix crossover with D4
in mid-calendar 2024.
In ﬁscal Q2, we also began volume production and shipments of the fastest PCIe
Gen4x4 NVMe SSD in the market, our 9400 176-layer performance NVMe data
center SSD, which excels in AI and high-performance computing workloads.
In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by mid-single-digit
percentage, returning PC unit volume to pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019.
Although still elevated, client customer inventories have improved meaningfully , and
we expect increased bit demand in the second half of the ﬁscal year . With our strong
product lineup, we are well positioned for the ongoing industry transition to D5.
Client's D5 adoption is expected to gradually increase through calendar 2023, with
D4 to D5 mix crossover in early to mid-calendar 2024.
In ﬁscal Q2, our NAND QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second
consecutive quarter , driven by growth in both client and consumer SSDs. W e
qualiﬁed our Micron 2400 SSD, the world's only 176-layer QLC SSD qualiﬁed at
OEMs, across the client customer base.
In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to
outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center .
Customers' inventory adjustments are progressing well, and we expect demand in
the calendar second half of 2023 to be stronger than the ﬁrst half. As the
performance leader in graphics, we are excited to see our proprietary 16-gigabit G6X
featured in the recently launched NVIDIA  RTX 4070 Ti.
In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down slightly
year-over-year . While some customer inventories are back to normal levels, other
OEMs' inventories remain elevated. In aggregate, we expect mobile customer
inventory to improve through the remainder of calendar 2023, and we expect growth
in mobile DRAM and NAND bit shipments in the second half of our ﬁscal year versus
the ﬁrst half.
In ﬁscal Q2, we continued sampling and qualifying our industry-leading 1-beta 16-
gigabit LP5X, receiving very positive feedback on its power , performance and quality
from customers. W e expect to generate revenue on this 1-beta product later this
ﬁscal year . We showcased our leading products earlier this month at Mobile W orld
Congress, where we displayed 8 ﬂagship mobile customer design wins.
Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which now represent over 20% of
our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and proﬁtability . Micron is the
market share leader in these important and fast-growing markets.
In ﬁscal Q2, auto revenue grew approximately 5% year-over-year . Our leadership in
automotive was evidenced by several milestones in Q2. W e reached a new record
customer quality score, qualiﬁed the industry's ﬁrst 176-layer e.MMC 5.1 automotive
product, and began shipping the industry's ﬁrst 176-layer UFS 3.1 automotive
solution. W e expect continued growth in auto memory demand for the second half of
calendar 2023, driven by gradually easing nonmemory supply constraints and
increasing memory content per vehicle.
The industrial market continued to soften in Q2, as our distribution channel partners
reduce their inventory levels and end demand weakened for some customers.
Inventories are starting to stabilize at the majority of our customers, and we expect
demand to improve in the second half of our ﬁscal year . In our ﬁscal second quarter ,
Micron achieved advanced startup sampling and design-in across automation OEMs,
ODMs and integrators with our latest generation of products.
Now turning to our market outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit
demand growth have moderated to approximately 5% in DRAM and low-teens
percentage range in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of
mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND. The
reduction in calendar 2023 demand from our prior forecast is driven by an
assessment of customer inventories as well as some degradation in end market
demand. W e expect that improving customer inventories will support sequential bit
demand growth for DRAM and NAND through the calendar year . China's reopening
is also a positive factor for calendar 2023 bit demand.
Public reports indicate that there have been signiﬁcant CapEx cuts throughout the
industry , and utilization rates have declined at all DRAM and NAND suppliers. W e
now expect that the industry bit supply growth for DRAM and NAND in calendar 2023
will be below demand growth, which will help improve supplier inventories. While the
supply-demand balance is expected to gradually improve due to the high levels of
inventories, industry proﬁtability and free cash ﬂow are likely to remain extremely
challenged in the near term.
Market recovery can accelerate if there is a year-to-year reduction in production or , in
other words, negative DRAM and NAND industry bit supply growth in 2023.
In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken a number of decisive
actions in ﬁscal 2023. First, we are further reducing our supply . We have made
additional reductions to our ﬁscal 2023 CapEx plan and now expect to invest
approximately $7 billion, down more than 40% from last year , with WFE down more
than 50%. In ﬁscal 2024, we expect WFE to fall further as we ramp 1-beta and 232-
layer nodes in a capital-efﬁcient manner . We have further reduced DRAM and NAND
wafer starts, which are now down by approximately 25%. As a result, for calendar
2023, we now expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully
negative for DRAM. W e also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023
than in calendar 2022. Excluding the impact of inventory write-downs, we expect
Micron's DIO to decline sequentially going forward from its peak in the second
quarter .
Second, we have made further reductions to our operating expenses beyond the
executive salary cuts and suspension of Micron's ﬁscal 2023 bonuses company-
wide. W e now expect our overall headcount reduction to approach 15%. This will
occur through a combination of workforce reductions, which are now largely
complete as well as anticipated attrition through the remainder of the year .
Third, Micron continues to execute to a strategy of maintaining ﬂat annual bit share in
both DRAM and NAND. While we have had to reduce price to remain competitive in
the market, we have not done so in an attempt to gain share. As such, share
changes at customers are generally transitory .
Lastly , we have taken additional steps to ensure ample liquidity . Mark will go into
further detail. Micron continues to have the strongest balance sheet among the pure-
play memory and storage companies, and our strong liquidity will enable us to
weather this downturn while ensuring our product and technology competitiveness.
I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay . Fiscal Q2 results reﬂected challenging market conditions with
continued deterioration in pricing and proﬁtability .
Total ﬁscal Q2 revenue was approximately $3.7 billion, down 10% sequentially and
53% year-over-year . Fiscal Q2 revenue included $1 14 million from an insurance
settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance.
Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 74% of total revenue. DRAM
revenue declined 4% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in the mid-teens
percentage range and prices declining by approximately 20%. Fiscal Q2 DRAM bit
shipments beneﬁted from the timing of shipments between ﬁscal Q1 and ﬁscal Q2.
Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $885 million, representing 24% of Micron's total
revenue. NAND revenue declined 20% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in
the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range and prices declining in the mid-20s
percentage range.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $1.4 billion, down 21% sequentially . And on a sequential basis, cloud
revenue was down while client revenue was stable.
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $945 million, up 44% sequentially . Mobile
revenue beneﬁted from the timing of some shipments between ﬁscal Q1 and ﬁscal
Q2.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $865 million, down 14% sequentially . On a
sequential basis, automotive markets were relatively stable following industrial and
consumer end markets experienced weakness.
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $507 million, down 25% sequentially
and impacted by challenging conditions in the NAND market.
Consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q2 was negative 31.4%. This result was
negatively impacted by approximately $1.4 billion or 38.7 percentage points of
inventory write-down recorded in the quarter . These noncash write-downs, which
lower the cost basis of inventory , resulted -- results from projected selling prices
falling below the cost of inventory and are not the result of obsolescence. Operating
expenses in ﬁscal Q2 were $916 million, down roughly $80 million sequentially . We
continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and expect them to decline
sequentially in both ﬁscal Q3 and ﬁscal Q4.
We had an operating loss of roughly $2.1 billion in ﬁscal Q2, resulting in an operating
margin of negative 56%, down from negative 2% in the prior quarter and positive
35% in the prior year . The operating loss included the $1.4 billion inventory write-
down recorded in the quarter for a 39 percentage point impact to operating margin.
Fiscal Q2 taxes were $53 million. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a
consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain
geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.
Non-GAAP  loss per share in ﬁscal Q2 was $1.91, down from a loss per share of
$0.04 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.14 in the prior year . Fiscal Q2
EPS included approximately $1.34 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-
down.
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. W e generated $343 million in cash from
operations in ﬁscal Q2, representing approximately 9% of revenue. Capital
expenditures were $2.2 billion during the quarter . We expect ﬁscal 2023 CapEx to be
2/3 front-half weighted, with a higher mix of construction spend in the second half.
Free cash ﬂow was negative $1.8 billion in the quarter . Our ending ﬁscal Q2
inventory was $8.1 billion and reﬂects the impact of the $1.4 billion write-down.
Average days of inventory for the quarter was 153 days, and excluding write-downs,
235 days. Inventory levels and days are higher in NAND than DRAM. Our actions on
supply reﬂect our intent to work down days of inventories from these levels.
At quarter end, we held cash and investments of $12.1 billion and had total liquidity
of $14.6 billion when considering our untapped credit facility .
Given macroeconomic uncertainty and the market environment, during the quarter ,
we bolstered our liquidity further through the addition of $1.9 billion of long-term debt.
Our ﬁscal Q2 ending debt was $12.3 billion.
Under a net debt position, our net interest income moves to net interest expense in
Q3. Micron's balance sheet is solid with ample liquidity , low net debt and a weighted
average maturity on debt of December 2029.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal third quarter . Market conditions remain
extremely challenging. However , we expect that for the rest of this calendar year ,
DRAM and NAND bit shipments will continue to increase and supply-demand
balance will gradually improve. Included in the ﬁscal third quarter guide is an
insurance recovery , separate and unrelated to that recognized in ﬁscal Q2 of
approximately $1 10 million, $70 million of which we expect to recognize as revenue.
In ﬁscal Q3, we expect gross margins to be negatively impacted by pricing, write-
down of inventory , cost of underutilization and a higher mix of NAND. On write-down
of inventory , our guidance assumes a write-down of approximately $500 million
associated with inventory produced during ﬁscal Q3. Small changes to price
expectations beyond ﬁscal Q3 could have a substantial positive or negative impact to
the inventory write-down amount in ﬁscal Q3. Potential variances of inventory write-
downs are not factored into the guidance ranges for gross margin and EPS.
As market conditions remain weak, we will continue to aggressively manage our
expense proﬁle. As Sanjay mentioned, we increased our headcount reduction target
to approach 15% from our previous target of approximately 10%. W e now expect
OpEx to fall below $850 million in the ﬁscal fourth quarter of 2023. For nonoperating
items, we expect net interest expense of approximately $5 million in ﬁscal Q3.
We now project ﬁscal 2023 taxes to be less than $140 million. W e expect proﬁtability
to remain extremely challenged in the near term. W e do project proﬁtability to
improve sequentially due to lower inventory write-downs and free cash ﬂow to
improve slightly , driven by reduced capital spend. But we forecast operating margin
and free cash ﬂow to remain signiﬁcantly negative through the ﬁscal year .
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for the ﬁscal Q3 is as follows.
We expect revenue to be $3.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be
in the range of negative 21%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating
expenses to be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax
expense of approximately $50 million.
Based on a share count of approximately 1.09 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a
loss of $1.58, plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we continue to aggressively manage
through this period of challenging market conditions, preserving our competitive
technology and product positions, strong operational capability and solid balance
sheet. Following this downturn, we expect to capitalize on the secular demand trends
and growth in memory and storage. W e believe we are close to a transition to
sequential revenue growth in our quarterly results. W e are focused on signiﬁcantly
improving proﬁtability and returning to positive quarterly free cash ﬂow within ﬁscal
2024. W e remain conﬁdent in our ﬁnancial model, and we'll continue to operate the
business in a disciplined manner to generate long-term proﬁtability , cash ﬂow and
shareholder returns.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. W e are carefully managing our business to weather this industry
downturn, preserving our technology and product portfolio competitiveness and
manufacturing capabilities. Micron is the leader in DRAM and NAND process
technology and one of only a handful of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturers
in the world. Our team continues to drive new breakthroughs for our customers.
Memory and storage are at the heart of systems and solutions that fuel the global
economic engine, drive new efﬁciencies, create higher productivity and spud
advances that make life better for people around the world. W e look forward to a
normalization of market conditions, and we remain conﬁdent in the long-term
demand for our solutions based on the value they create across multiple end
markets.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from
Evercore ISI.
Christopher Muse
I guess I was hoping to get your sense of how you're thinking about the shape of the
recovery . Obviously , things don't look great today , but you've been through this
before and will get through it. And so would love to hear your thoughts around how
you think will come out of this. And given the CapEx cuts we've seen across the
industry , it certainly looks like we're going to be an undersupply situation, at least for
DRAM in calendar '24. I'm curious what some of your largest customers are saying
today , particularly in the data center as they start to consider this likelihood.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thanks, C.J., for the question. So I think we can look at the question from the
demand and the supply point of view . And from the demand side, as we have
indicated that we are seeing that the customer inventories are improving while still
elevated, but in aggregate, customer inventories are improving. And we do expect
that the volume of shipments, both for DRAM and NAND, will continue to increase on
a sequential basis from here on.
And of course, on the supply side, you have heard actions from industry players and
through various reports, you have seen that the CapEx reductions are being made
as well as underutilization is being made in the industry . And that is going to be
taking out a chunk of – it will take a bite at the supply in the industry . So basically , the
supply trend will also begin to improve. So the demand and supply balance will
gradually improve through the course of the year .
We have said that inventory -- we believe also days of inventory will continue to
improve as well. For us, days of inventory peaked in Q2, and exclusive of inventory
adjustments, we would expect days of inventory to continue to improve from here on.
We have talked about for our business that we see being close to transition to
sequential growth in revenue going forward. So overall the industry environment,
with the demand and supply gradually improving, we expect the trajectory of pricing
also to be improving. So this then ultimately means that while the proﬁtability remains
challenged, and yes, free cash ﬂow remains challenged, but the fundamentals of the
industry are beginning to improve.
And certainly , with the actions that have been taken, it could be that in 2024
timeframe that there could be shortages in the industry . But overall, Micron, I think, is
taking decisive actions, as we have discussed, with respect to managing our CapEx,
managing underutilization in the fab, managing OpEx and really focusing on supply
growth as well.
And in terms of some of the market trends and the customer trends that you've
talked about, basically , we have shared that PC inventories are meaningfully better
and will continue to improve over the next couple of quarters. Smartphones, some
customers may have high inventory versus other customers, but inventories continue
to improve in the smartphone market over a couple of quarters as well.
Cloud revenue for us, we think, has bottomed in -- at Q2 timeframe. While
inventories in cloud remain at elevated levels, inventories in data center remain at
elevated levels. W e do expect them to improve through the course of the year
towards -- and get to normalized levels by the end of the year as well. And in cloud,
the new CPUs do drive new D5 deployment, and Micron is well positioned with
DDR5 with our strong position with the product. So we think that DDR5 is also
tailwinds for the cloud demand with increased memory per server content that it will
be driving as well.
So these are all positive trends. And while we are navigating the business through an
extremely challenging environment, I hope you see that Micron is responsibly
managing its supply and continuing to focus on improving the demand supply
environment for us. Of course, as we have said, the recovery in the industry could be
accelerated if the demand -- if the supply for DRAM and NAND in terms of year-over-
year growth was negative. W e, of course, have taken our actions to bring our DRAM
and our NAND supply growth for the year to be negative.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
I had a 2-part question. First, Sanjay , I was curious -- just following on the last
question, what are the lasting changes that you think that the industry is going to
implement coming out of the cycle? I mean it's been so much worse than I think any
of us thought it would be. Do you think that the industry and you -- I mean, certainly ,
you, it sounds like, but do you think the industry is going to be more draconian about
adding bit supply? Do you think you can engage customers in more L TAs, given that
the writing clearly is on the wall about where pricing is going to go after all this?
And then I guess also then for Mark, a question on the write-down for May . Why
keep on producing if you're going to immediately write-down $500 million worth of
inventory? Is it that you've hit some sort of ﬂoor in terms of utilization where you can't
go below that? I'm just curious why you'd produce and you'd immediately write that
down.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So I think with respect to the industry environment, you have to look at that over the
course of last 3 years, the world faced once-in-100-years kind of pandemic, once-in-
multiple-decades kind of Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on the economy , 40-
year-high inﬂation and its impact on the macro. And all of these really resulted in an
environment that created a material dislocation in terms of the demand, the surge in
demand, and then the inventory adjustments that took place and resulted in a
material dislocation in the customer behavior as well.
And now you are seeing the process of recovery that is starting, the process of
recovery with respect to the supply growth reductions actions that are being
implemented. W e talked about ours today . And so this will ultimately lead to the
industry to recover to healthier levels. The proﬁtability levels in the industry today are
simply not sustainable. So the demand and supply environment has to improve in the
industry . And keep in mind that before this period of last 2 to 3 years with all these
events that I just mentioned, the industry for 10 years plus has been disciplined
particularly in DRAM. So I do believe that the investments in the future that require
healthy levels of proﬁtability and, of course, supply discipline will be back and the
industry will grow .
And particularly , keeping it in mind the strong demand trends. I talked about 2025
being -- we think will be a record revenue year for the industry because last 2 years
have been slow demand growth in terms of shipments. W e think '24 and '25 will be
strong years that will drive strong growth. You are seeing actions on the supply side.
The health of the industry will be restored in the future quarters.
And no doubt that AI -- and we talk about generative AI, right? I mean this is very ,
very early stages of generative AI, and these are the trends that ultimately really
drive greater demand for a long time to come for memory and storage. I mean when
you look at really the future, it equals AI and AI equals memory , and Micron is well
positioned with our technology and product roadmaps to address the growing
opportunities there.
Mark Murphy
Yes. Tim, on your second question, we have been actively taking supply out of the
market. W e took utilization levels down late summer . We increased that more in the
fall. And as you heard on the call today , we've taking utilization down even further .
And it's -- we're at levels now that none of us have seen before on underutilization at
Micron and maybe in the company's history . So it's a signiﬁcant reduction.
I'll add that we do, as you know , build principally to WIP . So we're able to then ﬁnish
those products later and minimize the amount of build. W e've also very thoughtfully ,
when we've reduced utilization, done it in the way that we can maximize the cash
beneﬁts reductions that we get when we reduce. And then it's important to note that
in the time horizon that we're looking at, we are seeing bit volumes increase
sequentially from here on out.
Now in the third quarter , I will note just some housekeeping that DRAM volumes
were up modestly in the third quarter , and NAND is up sharply -- as strongly , I should
say. And while both are price-challenged, NAND is more challenged. But again, we
are seeing growth in bits, and we expect that too is the beginning of supply/demand
getting into better balance.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Christopher Danely
Just a couple of speciﬁc questions on the expected recovery . Is your base case -- I
guess in terms of the PC and cell phone demand for the second half of this year , is
your base case expecting those end markets to get back to normal seasonality? And
how should we expect utilization rates to trend as you continue to increase DRAM
and NAND shipments? Should we expect you to get back to full utilization rates in a
couple of quarters? Or is there some sort of revenue or bit level that you could give
us that would indicate that you're back to full utilization?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to the utilization rates, of course, we will continue to monitor the
industry demand, and it's important for us to continue to work on bringing our days of
inventory down, and utilization could continue into ﬁscal year '24 as well. W e'll make
decisions regarding utilization as a function of, again, our latest status in the future
around our inventory position and assessment of demand.
Regarding your question on the smartphone market, as we have said that in
calendar year '24, we expect that smartphone unit volume will decline on a year-
over-year basis, and Q2 growth for us was above seasonal. And as customers'
inventory levels normalize over the course of the year , then normal demand trends
will also be restored in the smartphone market.
And regarding the smartphone market, even though the unit volume may be down on
a year-over-year basis, important thing is that the smartphone market is shifting its
mix more towards ﬂagship phones, and ﬂagship phones require more memory as
well. So these are some of the trends that will play out as the demand grows over the
course of the year for -- in the smartphone market.

And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
On the underutilization charge, I know last call the team had articulated roughly $460
million of charges recognized primarily in ﬁscal Q3 and Q4. So how much of this is
embedded in your Q3 numbers and Q3 guidance? And given the lower utilization,
tick it down to 25% or cut it by 25%. If you continue to drive lower utilization through
the second half of this calendar year , like how do we think about some of the
utilization charges in ﬁscal Q4 and second half of this calendar year?
Mark Murphy
Yes. Harlan, so I'll answer it brieﬂy here at the beginning and then maybe take the
opportunity to just talk through gross margins and ef fective utilization gross margin.
So based on what we told you last quarter and I went into some length last quarter
about the charges and period costs and so forth. But last quarter , we thought we'd
have around $900 million in ﬁscal '23 and about $460 million would hit FY  '23 COGS.
With the underutilization that we've stepped up here, we see now about $1.1 billion in
'23, and this is a combination of cost and inventory and period costs, and we actually
see about $900 million of that ﬂowing into FY  '23. And that's driven by not only the
increase in utilization costs -- underutilization cost is driven by the ef fects of the write-
down and the accounting -- or inventory write-downs and the pull forward of cost. So
if we step back and we look at our reported gross margin and our outlook, their a
function of many factors, including pricing, inventory write-downs, which incorporate
our forward view of pricing, the ef fects of utilization, volumes and the associated
leverage on period costs, as we discussed last quarter , and of course, mix. These
factors are continuously changing due to the market environment and our actions.
And then further , I'll add that at these lower levels of proﬁtability , the margin forecast
and the results are more sensitive to slight changes in assumptions, importantly ,
such as price. So on price, given the recent price trends that we've seen and our
current view on pricing, as we reported in Q2, we took a material write-down of
inventories of $1.4 billion. And then the Q3 guide contemplates a write-down of $500
million on these additional inventories produced.
With these write-downs, we pulled forward inventory costs and thus, we've lowered
the carrying value of on-hand inventories. And as those lower cost inventory clears in
future quarters, we'll realize more income in those quarters than we would have
without the charge. So as an example, we expect around a $300 million beneﬁt in Q3
from the Q2 charge as a portion of these lower cost inventories sell through. So as
per your question, we also now have the underutilization ef fects creating higher cost
inventories and then adding additional period costs. And as mentioned, we see about
$1.1 billion of underutilization impact in FY  '23, and most of that, as I mentioned, we
expect to hit the P&L  this year and some of it will carry over to next year . Now
because of the ef fective write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year
than would have otherwise.
Now considering all this, we expect our reported second quarter gross margin to be
the trough, so that 31.4%. And that, again, is driven in large part by the $1.4 billion
write-down. With a much lower inventory charge forecasted in the third quarter , you
see that we guided about 10 points better relative to Q2. Now again, these estimates
are very sensitive to pricing changes, but in our current view , Q4 would be better
than Q3 in the sense of a lower charge, if any . And then over time, as bit volumes
grow as I talked about in the last call and we talked about today , we get leverage on
our period costs and utilization improves.
First, it will improve in the back end, then we'll have better utilization on the front end.
And most importantly , as customer inventories continue to improve, inventories come
down and supply/demand balance is better , we would expect reported margins to
improve through FY  '24. But again, a lot of factors at work here. If you were to just
strip out the impairment charges or the write-downs in second and third quarters, Q2
would be a 7.3% gross margin, 3Q would be a negative 7.5% margin, so down
considerably . And again, this is a function of the pricing environment and the cost of
underutilization, including period costs, which, again, I discussed last quarter .
Under this view , we would trough in the second half on gross margin, then would
improve of f these low levels through FY  '24. So the -- in the end, the proﬁle of the
outlook is similar to what we discussed last quarter , though, of course, levels are
lower with the pricing environment we've seen and the recovery is a bit delayed
because of a bit lower volumes. But again, trough in the second half and some
improvement expected through FY  '24.

Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari
One question on the NAND business end market. You talked about your bit
production being down year-over-year in calendar '23, which I believe is a little bit
more draconian than most of your competition. Just curious how you're thinking
about the strategy in NAND. Could this cause permanent damage to your relative
competitiveness? And kind of related to that, one of your competitors has signiﬁcant
capacity in China. W ondering if you had customers come to you and express
concerns around that, and if that could be a potential relative positive for you over
the medium to long term.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to NAND, we are well positioned with our technology and product
roadmap. W e shared with you today that 176-layer NAND yields are doing
exceptionally well. 232-layer NAND, we have begun shipping in the market already .
And with 176, as well as 232-layer , we have been well ahead of any competitor in the
industry . 90% plus of our supply today in NAND that we are shipping is 176 plus 232-
layers. So overall, we are well positioned with our technology . Our underutilization
actions, we really believe are -- is what is needed to bring supply in line with
demand, and we think these are the actions that are needed to restore the health of
the business. And we have said in our prepared remarks that the industry recovery
could be accelerated if NAND and DRAM supply growth, production growth, is
negative on a year-over-year basis. And we certainly are taking our actions
accordingly .
And regarding China, I can't really comment on the part of other customers. But what
I can tell you is that our customers really do see a strong technology execution, a
strong product execution from Micron, and it's our product portfolio. W e have done
well with leveraging our NAND and DRAM in mobile markets with multichip
packages.
In automotive, I talked about some of the NAND product portfolio expanding and
creating opportunities to strengthen our leadership position in automotive markets.
And certainly , in the data center market, SSDs is also an opportunity . And our Gen4
NVMe SSDs have been continuing to do well in the client market as well. So our
customers see our execution and innovation capabilities in technology and products,
and that's what is bringing us stronger relationships with our customers for the NAND
business.
And of course, in terms of market opportunities, those continue to be healthy in terms
of NAND-displacing HDDs in the data center , and Micron having the right products to
grow those opportunities in the future. This has been -- we have been -- with NVMe
SSDs and data center , we have been absent in the past, and now we have a healthy
product portfolio, and we look forward to growing our opportunities in that space in
the future. So NAND overall, in combination with DRAM, enables us to have a strong
differentiated value for our customers. And Micron is well positioned with our
technology and product roadmap, and certainly , we believe that our supply actions
here are prudent.

And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from W ells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers
So Mark, I apologize, I just want to go back to the inventory discussion a little bit. Is
there any way to bridge the prior comment of the $460 million, again, that Harlan had
brought up relative to that? It sounds like $900 million for ﬁscal '23. I'm just curious
on what's embedded in the gross margin for underutilization this quarter . And I guess
on inventory , is there any risk of obsolescence of inventory? Or is the inventory good,
it just gets sold through at a lower cost of goods at this point?
Mark Murphy
Yes, the inventory is still good. It just gets it -- the cost basis is lower on the
inventories. And then as far as your question on underutilization charges. So we do
have, as just bridging it from what we said last time, last time we had total
underutilization charges of about $900 million that were incurred in FY  '23, of which
we believe that $460 million would pass through to the P&L  in FY  '23. And that $460
million was a combination of costs and inventories that clear and then also period
costs.
Now our view with the increased underutilization, our view is $1.1 billion of costs in
FY '23. And the amount that we believe will pass through in the second half year is
$900 million. Again, that is a combination of costs that are in inventory and period
costs. Now the reason it's a higher percent of the total FY  '23 cost that we saw is
because of this write-down accounting where that -- those inventory charges are
pulled forward. So I hope that clears up the question.

And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley .
Joseph Moore
Sorry if I missed this, and I appreciate the detailed puts and takes on gross margin.
With regards to the lower cost or market adjustment, can you walk through the
mechanics of how you got to this number for the February quarter? I guess a little
over $1.4 billion. Is that -- I know you pull the inventory and then you compare that to
the market price. How far out in time does that market price assessment take you?
And I guess, to the extent that you're -- there's more than one quarter of sell-through
that's being adjusted, how are you making the determination of what the price will be
there?
Mark Murphy
That's right, Joe. You did a decent job of sort of answering the question. But if you -- I
would refer you to our public ﬁlings, but as a reminder , we evaluate the recoverability
of inventory as a single pool. This method we've applied consistently and as
disclosed, we analyzed the recoverability of our inventory based on quantities and
values on hand at the end of each quarter .
We project the period over which that inventory will be sold based on our most recent
forecast and consider the expected selling prices during that forecast horizon. Since
the pre-write-down inventory , days of inventory were about 235 days. That projection
covers nearly 3 quarters. The amount by which our inventory carrying cost exceeds
expected sales values adjusted for selling expenses determines the charge. And in
this case, that yielded a $1.4 billion write-down in the second quarter , and we expect
that same process to result in a $500 million charge in the third quarter .

Our next question and ﬁnal question for this session comes from the line of Krish
Sankar from Cowen.
Hadi Orabi
This is Eddy for Krish from TD Cowen. It seems you adjusted the language regarding
your DDR4 and DDR5 crossover date from mid-2024 to mid-to-early 2024, so slightly
better than prior outlook. It's a bit surprising given that data center inventory for
DDR4 is pretty high. Is that improved outlook driven by better-than-expected demand
for new CPUs from Intel and AMD? Or is it a function of you seeing higher share than
expected in DDR5? Or is it more of data center customers buying ahead and taking
advantage of low price environment? Any color regarding the improved outlook
would be helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Regarding the mix of D4 to D5 transition, the comments that I made were for the
industry trends, and those have not really changed versus our prior expectations. Of
course, there are functions -- they are a function of deployment of the new CPUs,
such as AMD Genoa and Intel Sapphire Rapids into the servers, into the data center
infrastructure. And those -- and you are seeing that those CPUs are now starting to
get broadly deployed and will continue to increase through the course of '23 and '24.
So our expectations in terms of transition timing for D4 to D5 for the industry have
not changed, and yes, we remain well positioned with our D5 product in the market.
