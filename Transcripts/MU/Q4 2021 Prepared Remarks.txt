Intro/FQ 4 Highlights  
We delivered outstanding results in fiscal Q4, achieving robust profitability and the second -highest 
quarterly revenue in Micron's history. Strong execution drove healthy results across segments, including 
record quarterly revenue in NAND as well as in our embedded business.   
Fiscal 2021 was a year of many records for Micron. We achieved our highest -ever mobile revenue, driven 
by all -time-high managed NAND revenue and multichip package ( MCP ) mix. Our embedded business had 
a tremendous record -breaking year, with auto and industrial businesses both at substantial new highs. 
And our Crucial -branded consumer business and overall QLC mix in NAND all hit records in fiscal 2021.

 Through the year, w e successfully navigated multiple obstacles brought on by the pandemic and reached 
several key milestones. For the first time in Micron’s history, we established technology leadership 
concurrently in both DRAM and NAND. Micron’s 1α (1-alpha ) DRAM and 17 6-layer NAND are the 
industry’s most advanced nodes in high -volume production. And we further strengthened our product 
leadership by becoming first to introduce LP5X DRAM and uMCP5 managed NAND in mobile, and the 
industry’s first functional safety -capable LP5 for automotive applications.  
The secular demand for memory and storage, combined with Micron’s focused execution and our rock -
solid balance sheet, position s us well to deliver strong financial performance and create significant 
shareholder valu e in fiscal 2022 and beyond. Demonstrating our confidence in our business trajectory, we 
initiated a quarterly dividend that we aim to grow over time.  
Technology and Operation s 
Memory is at the leading edge of semiconductor manufacturing, and Micron has le adership in both 
DRAM and NAND technology. This quarter, we reached mature yields in our ramp of 1α DRAM and 
176-layer NAND 20% to 30% faster than prior nodes and delivered performance and feature 
improvements that will help unleash customer innovat ion. We believe we are several quarters ahead of 
the industry in deployment of these process technologies. Additionally, through deeper customer 
collaboration, we have further accelerated the time to market for value -added solutions built using these 
nodes . 1α and 1z DRAM nodes combined now represent the majority of our DRAM bit production driven 
by strong growth of 1α production, and by the end of the calendar year, 176 -layer NAND will make up the 
majority of our NAND bit production.  
Looking beyond 1α DRAM and 176 -layer NAND, we are investing to sustain scaling in both technologies 
for the next decade. Adding momentum to our years of R&D in extreme ultraviolet ( EUV) lithography , we 
recently took delivery of the industry’s latest EUV system, NXE 3600, at  our Boise headquarters, where we 
operate one of the world’s most advanced centers for semiconductor research and development. The 
delivery of this tool is an important milestone toward our previously disclosed plan of implementing EUV 
in high -volume manuf acturing in the 2024 time  frame . We expect that the integration of EUV with our 
existing multi patterning  immersion lithography expertise  will help us maintain DRAM technology 
leadership for many years to come.  
In addition to being a technology lead er and an innovation partner, we are uniquely positioned as a 
strategic supplier to our customers. Micron is the only U.S. -based memory company, and our strong 
global manufacturing network provides us with a diversified source of supply, which has become 
increasingly critical to ensure that we continue to deliver product reliably to our customers. The 
advantages of this unique position have been proven throughout the past 18 months, as we have 
successfully navigated the challenges of COVID -19 across our glo bal manufacturing network while 
maintaining continuity of supply to our customers.

 End Markets  
Now let us review our end markets. The demand for memory and storage has evolved dramatically from 
the PC -centric era. Today, demand for memory and storage is dr iven from diversified end markets that 
extend from the data center to the intelligent edge  and to a growing diversity of user devices. As a result 
of growing memory and storage content per device, DRAM and NAND now account for an ever -
increasing portion of the bill of materials for our customers. DRAM and NAND total addressable market 
(TAM ) share of the semiconductor industry has steadily grown over the last two decades from around 
10% to approximately 30% today. The  artificial intelligence  (AI) and 5G revolution is only in its infancy, and 
as these secular growth drivers gain further traction, we expect new data -intensive applications to 
continue to fuel significant increases in DRAM and NAND TAM.  
Data Center  
In the fiscal fourth quarter, data center revenue grew sequentially and year over year, fueled by secular 
drivers in cloud demand and a re surgence of enterprise IT investment linked to improving economic 
growth. Data center has become the largest market for memory and storage, driven by the rapid growth 
in cloud. With our broadening portfolio of differentiated products across memory and stor age, we are in a 
strong position to drive strong growth and profitability in this important segment.  We have been engaged 
on DDR5 from initial specification development and are well placed to support customer transitions to 
DDR5 -enabled platforms starting later this calendar year. We are also enhancing our NVMe SSD portfolio 
and will soon introduce PCIe Gen4 data center SSDs with Micron -designed controllers and leveraging the 
full benefit of vertical integration. These SSDs will strengthen our market positi on over the course of the 
coming quarters and years in the fast -growing data center NVMe storage market.  
PC 
Work - and learn -from -anywhere trends are driving a second consecutive year of double -digit PC unit 
sales growth in calendar 2021. In the fiscal four th quarter, PC DRAM revenue was up significantly year 
over year. We are making strong progress transitioning our PC DRAM to our 1α node, which represented 
a meaningful portion of our FQ4 PC bit shipments. Client QLC SSD bit mix hit a new record and  made up 
the majority of our client SSD bit shipments in FQ4. Our QLC leadership enhances our bit supply capability 
and product profitability. We also have continued momentum ramping 176 -layer NAND products for the 
PC market, and we qualified our 176 -layer  NAND -based Gen4 NVMe client SSDs with several PC OEMs 
during the quarter.   
Graphics  
In graphics, revenue increased sequentially and year over year, driven by a continuation of last quarter’s 
strong next -generation game console and graphics card shipments.  Micron holds an excellent position in 
 
Micron Technology, Inc.

 the fast -growing graphics market, with a broad product portfolio featuring our proprietary GDDR6X 
product line and deep partnerships with leading GPU suppliers.  
Mobile  
FQ4 mobile revenue increased more than 25% year o ver year, driven by continued unit sales and content 
growth. We expect overall smartphone unit sales to grow this year, with sales of over 500 million 5G 
mobile phones forecasted. These content -rich 5G phones feature more than 50% higher DRAM and 
double th e NAND content than 4G phones. We expect 5G and AI to drive new innovation in applications 
such as AI -optimized video capture and editing that will fuel DRAM and NAND content growth for years 
to come. Our 1α LP4 16Gb design is now fully qualified and ramping at multiple OEMs, while our 
176-layer NAND achieved its first UFS 3.1 qualifications at two OEMs. These wins demonstrate Micron’s 
leadership in the mobile market  and our continued strength in managed NAND products, where MCP 
sales su rpassed $1 billion for the third straight quarter.  
Auto  & Industrial  
We are continuing to see strong demand in our edge markets, which include  automotive and industrial 
IoT. We expect the automotive and industrial markets to be the fastest -growing memory and storage 
markets over the next decade. As the No. 1 player in these markets, Micron is exceptionally well 
positioned to benefit from these secular growth trends.   
Our automotive business delivered a fourth consecutive record quarter, driven by continued  recovery in 
auto manufacturing and the growth of memory and storage content driven by in -vehicle infotainment 
and driver -assistance applications.  
Industrial IoT revenues also set records in the fiscal fourth quarter, benefiting from the continued growth 
of applications such as point -of-sale devices, factory automation and surveillance. We expect industrial 
demand trends to accelerate further as 5G speeds the adoption of data -intensive applications powered by 
intelligent edge infrastructure. We are also se eing an acceleration in our consumer IoT business, driven by 
rapid growth in devices such as VR headsets, smart exercise equipment  and smart speakers.  
Market  Outlook  
Turning to market outlook, calendar 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year. We expect cal endar 2021 
industry DRAM bit demand growth to be in the low 20% range and industry NAND bit demand growth to 
be in the high 30% range.  
Overall, our preliminary view is that calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth will be consistent with 
long-term industr y bit demand growth compound annual growth rates ( CAGRs ) — in the mid to high 
 
Micron Technology, Inc.

 teens for DRAM and approximately 30% for NAND.  We anticipate underlying demand in calendar 2022 to 
be led by increasing data center server deployments, 5G mobile shipments and co ntinued strength in 
automotive and industrial markets. Additionally, non -memory supply shortages that are constraining 
customer builds across various end market segments and that are pushing out some demand  should ease 
throughout 2022, supporting demand g rowth during the year. Given prudent industry capex and very lean 
supplier inventories, we expect healthy industry supply -demand balance and robust profitability for both 
DRAM and NAND in the year.  
In the near term, our FQ1 bit shipments will decline mode stly in both DRAM and NAND from very strong 
levels in FQ4. Some PC customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of 
non-memory components that are needed to complete PC builds. We expect this adjustment at our PC 
customers to be largely resolved in the coming months.  We are also seeing constraints within our supply 
chain for certain IC components, which will somewhat limit our bit shipments in the near term.  Bit 
shipment growth will resume in the second half of the fiscal year,  and we are planning to deliver record 
revenue with solid profitability in fiscal 22.  Our CY22 bit shipment growth for DRAM and NAND will be 
inline with the industry.  However, due to the strong shipments in FY 21 and our below -normal current 
inventory level, for FY22 , our bit shipment growth for DRAM and NAND will somewhat lag the long -term 
CAGRs.  
In FY22, the continued ramp of 1α and 176 -layer NAND should provide us with good front -end cost 
reductions. Our efforts to increase supply  chain resilience and provide business continuity to our 
customers will cause headwinds to our assembly and packaging costs, consistent with the trend in the 
overall industry. Overall, we expect annual cost per bit reductions to be competitive with the ind ustry in 
FY22 and over the long term.   
Turning to capital expenditures. We expect FY22 capex in the range of $11 billion to $12 billion. The year -
on-year increase in capex is driven by our continued 176 -layer NAND transition, pilot line enablement for 
next-generation NAND and DRAM, and continued infrastructure and pre payments to support the 
introduction of EUV. FY22 DRAM equipment capex for manufacturing will decline from FY21, as we benefit 
from the capital efficiency of our mature 1α node.  
For FY22, our bit supply growth will be achieved through node transitions alone, as we are a few years 
away from needing wafer start additions to keep up with the industry demand. We also expect to increase 
FY22 R&D investment by approximately 15% from FY21 t o deliver bold product and technology 
innovations designed to fuel the data economy, as well as to expand our portfolio to capitalize on 
opportunities such as high -bandwidth memory and Compute Express Link ( CXL) solutions.  
Our leadership portfolio, product quality, supply chain agility and deep customer relationships make us a 
preferred partner in many of our markets, and we are confident in our ability to continue to create long -
term, sustained profitability and returns bui lt on that leadership.

 I will now turn it over to Dave.  
Dave Zinsner, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer  
Thanks , Sanjay.  
Opening  
Micron delivered excellent FQ4 results highlighted by our second -highest quarterly revenue, strong gross 
and operating margins, and substantial positive free cash flow.  
Revenue  
Total FQ4 revenue was approximately $8.3 billion, up 11% quarter over quarter and up 37% year over 
year. As a reminder , FQ4 of last year was a 14 -week quarter and impacts our year -over-year comparisons. 
FQ4 revenue growth was broad -based with solid demand and price increases in both DRAM and NAND.  
Our robust growth in FQ4 contributed to strong performance in FY21 with revenue of $27.7 billion, which 
was up 29% from the prior fiscal year.  
DRAM 
FQ4 DRAM revenue was $6.1 billion, representing 74% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 12% 
sequentially and was up 39% year over year. Bit shipments increased in the lower single -digit percentage 
sequentially, and average selling prices ( ASPs ) increased in the high single -digit percent range quarter 
over quarter.  
For the fiscal year, DRAM revenue increased 38% year over year to $20 billion, representing 72% of total 
fiscal year revenue.  
NAND  
FQ4 NAND revenue was approximately $2 billion, an all -time high  and representing 24% of the total 
revenue. NAND revenue increased 9% sequentially and was up 29% year over year. Bit shipments 
increased by low single -digit percentage s sequentially, while ASPs increased in the mid  single -digit 
percent range quart er over quarter.  
For the fiscal year, we achieved a new company record for NAND revenue of $7 billion, an increase of 14% 
year over year.  NAND revenue represented 25% of our total fiscal year revenue.

 Revenue by Business Unit  
Now turning to our FQ4 revenue  trends by business unit.  
Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.8 billion, up 15% sequentially and up 26% 
year over year. Growth was led by the data center and graphics markets.  
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, down 5% sequentially and up 29% year over year. 
Mobile demand remained healthy in the quarter with continued momentum from the rollout of 5G. MBU 
revenue for FY21 exceeded $7 billion and set a new record.  
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.2 bill ion, up 19% from the prior quarter and up 32% year 
over year. Data center SSDs had strong growth in the quarter driven by enterprise and cloud strength. 
QLC shipments set a new record in the fiscal year, in terms of percentage of our NAND shipments.  
Finally, the Embedded Business Unit generated record revenue of $1.4 billion, which was up 23% 
sequentially and more than doubled year over year. We continue to experience strong demand across the 
automotive and industrial markets. For the fiscal year, EBU reve nue easily exceeded $4 billion, setting a 
new revenue record.  
Operating Results  
Gross Margin  
The consolidated gross margin for FQ4 was 47.9%, up 500 basis points from the prior quarter. Pricing 
increases across DRAM and NAND as well as strong execution in our ongoing product portfolio 
transformation drove margin expansion in the quarter.  
Opex 
Operating expenses in FQ4 were $891 million , on the lower end of the range we provided in last quarter’s 
earnings call.  
Operating Income  
FQ4 operating income was $3.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 37%, up from 32% in FQ3 and 
up from 21% in the prior year.  
FQ4 EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ) was $4.7 billion, resulting in 
an EBITDA mar gin of 57.1%, compared to 53.3% in the prior quarter and 47.4% in the prior year. For the 
 
Micron Technology, Inc.  
Fiscal Q 4 2021 Earnings Call  Prepared Remarks  
 
© 2021 Micron Technology, Inc.  8 Sept. 28, 2021  
 
 fiscal year, total EBITDA was $14 billion, up from $9 billion in the prior fiscal year, and represented 50.4% 
of revenues.  
Earnings Per Share  
Non-GAAP earnings per sh are (EPS) in FQ4 were $2.42, up from $1.88 in FQ3 and up from $1.08 in the 
year-ago quarter. EPS included approximately $0.02 of gains from investments in our venture arm, Micron 
Ventures.  
For the fiscal year, total EPS was $6.06, up more than 100% from the $2.83 achieved in the prior fiscal year.  
Operating Cash Flow  
Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated $3.9 billion in cash from operations in FQ4, 
representing 47% of revenue. For the fiscal year, cash from operations totaled $12.5  billion, up from $8.3 
billion in the prior fiscal year.  
Capital Allocation  
Net capital spending was $2 billion during the quarter and $9.7 billion in FY21.  
We generated positive free cash flow of $1.9 billion in FQ4 and over $2.8 billion for the fiscal ye ar. The 
increased cash flow was driven by strong revenue growth, increased profitability and efficient working 
capital management.  
As Sanjay mentioned, we expect our FY22 capital spending to be between $11 billion and $12 billion. Like 
FY21, we expect our  capital spending to be weighted more to the first half of the fiscal year, which will 
constrain free cash flow in FQ1 and FQ2. We do expect to generate healthy free cash flow in FY22 but 
weighted toward the back -half of the year. We also expect to close o ur Lehi fab sale within FQ1 , and we 
will receive approximately $900 million in proceeds from the sale.  
We completed share repurchases of $1.1 billion, or approximately 13.9 million shares, in FQ4. For the fiscal 
year, we repurchased $1.2 billion or app roximately 15.6 million shares.  
From FY17 to FY21, we generated over $20 billion of free cash flow. During this period, we used 
approximately $5 billion of that cash flow to retire debt and $7 billion toward buying back stock and 
eliminating the dilution from convertible debt, reducing our share count by 148 million shares. We also 
improved our total cash and investment position by $5.5 billion.  We expect that we will continue to 
generate strong free cash flow in the future, and as we discussed on our capi tal return strategy call in 
early August, we are committed to returning more than 50% of cross -cycle free cash flow to shareholders 
through a combination of buybacks and a quarterly dividend that we expect we can grow over time.  The

 first dividend payment of $0.10 per share will be paid on Oct . 18 to shareholders of record as of Oct. 1. 
The initiation of a dividend is an important milestone that reflects the structural transformation Micron 
has undergone over the last several years,  and it shows our confidence in the sustainability of our cash 
flow generation.  
Inventory  
Our ending FQ4 inventory was $4.5 billion and average days for the quarter were 94 days, below our 
normal range of 95  to 105 days. FQ4 finished -goods dollar inventor y ended at the lowest level since the 
Elpida acquisition in 2013.  
Total Cash/Debt  
We ended the fiscal year with $10.5 billion of total cash and investments and $13 billion of total liquidity. 
Our FQ4 total debt was $6.8 billion.  
Outlook  
Now turning to our outlook. End demand across our major markets remains strong. As Sanjay mentioned, 
our bit shipments are expected to decline modestly in FQ1, as we normalize our inventory position and 
work with PC customers as they manage through their supply chain challen ges. And, on the gross margin 
side, our outlook is similar to how we viewed FQ4.  While we will benefit from our node transitions on both 
DRAM and NAND, we will continue to see near -term headwinds from COVID -related expenses in 
assembly and packaging.  As a result, we expect the gross margins in FQ1 to be largely a function of the 
mix. 
Non-GAAP Guidance  
With all these factors in mind, our non -GAAP guidance for FQ1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be 
$7.65 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 47% plus or minus 100 basis 
points; and operating expenses to be approximately $915 million, plus or minus $25 million. Excluding the 
impact of any potential new tax legislation, we expect our non -GAAP tax rate to be approximat ely 10% for 
FQ1. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $2.10, 
plus or minus $0.10.  
Closing   
In closing, fiscal 2021 was a year of considerable growth and success for Micron. Looking at four -year 
average metrics reveals the sustained cross -cycle performance of our business. Over the last four years , 
our gross margins have exceeded 40% and our operating cash flow margins have been approximately 
50%. Despite the challenges stemming from the ongoing pande mic, we have continued to generate

 significant positive free cash flow while making substantial investments to grow our business. Our 
technology, product and financial position provide  strong momentum as we enter the new fiscal year.   
I will now turn it b ack to Sanjay.  
Sanjay Mehrotra, President and Chief Executive Officer  
Thank you, Dave.  
I would like to share a recent accomplishment that makes me especially proud of our company. Our 
strong Micron culture has played a significant role in driving our results aligned to our broader vision to 
transform how the world uses information to enrich life for all . Our company culture, community 
leadership and business performance are being recognized globally, earning multiple industry awards and 
recognitions this year. This month, we were ranked by Fortune as one of the top 20 best places to work i n 
manufacturing and production, the only semiconductor company to earn this recognition.  
Fiscal 21 was an excellent year for Micron. As our fourth -quarter results clearly demonstrate, we are 
delivering strong financial results. We are planning to deliver r ecord revenues and solid profitability in 
FY22. Demand for memory and storage is solid across market segments. Industry trends like the broad 
integration of artificial intelligence into all computing, proliferation of the intelligent edge, continued data 
center growth, and deployments of 5G networks create new and expanding opportunities for Micron. The 
importance of semiconductors to these markets is underscored by government initiatives to invest in 
domestic semiconductor production, both here in the U.S.  through the CHIPS Act and in other countries 
around the world.   
We are focused on building our technology leadership to deliver bold new solutions that offer unique 
value to our customers. Our business is robust, and we are energized to seize the opportun ities ahead of 
us, at a truly exciting time in the semiconductor industry.  
We will now open for questions.
