Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. In ﬁscal Q1, Micron delivered revenue,
gross margin, and EPS above the high-end of the guidance ranges we provided at
the last earnings call, reﬂecting Micron's strong execution combined with improved
pricing. W e are in the very early stages of a multi-year growth phase catalyzed and
driven by generative AI, and this disruptive technology will eventually transform every
aspect of business and society . Memory is at the heart of GPU-enabled AI servers,
and we are already seeing strong demand driven by early deployment of AI
solutions, which will only accelerate over time. Micron is well positioned to leverage
this growth, having executed the most robust set of new technology and product
introductions in our 45-year history .
The improved supply-demand environment in the current calendar quarter gives us
additional conﬁdence in the trajectory of our business. W e have driven a strong
inﬂection in industry pricing this calendar quarter , which will allow us to beneﬁt from
higher prices earlier in our ﬁscal year compared to our prior plans. W e intend to stay
very disciplined with our supply and capacity investments as our pricing is still far
from levels associated with necessary ROI. W e expect our pricing to continue to
strengthen through the course of calendar 2024. W e expect improved margins and
ﬁnancial performance throughout 2024 and record industry TAM in calendar 2025.
We have made signiﬁcant progress with our industry-leading technology roadmap.
Micron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes
in both DRAM and NAND. The vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes:
1-alpha and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND. As previously
stated, both 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes have reached mature yields
faster than the prior nodes. W e expect ﬁscal 2024 front-end cost reductions to track
in line with our long-term expectations of mid- to high-single-digits in DRAM and low-
teens in NAND. W e are on track for volume production in 1-gamma DRAM using
EUV in calendar 2025.
Now turning to our end markets. Inventories for memory and storage are at or near
normal levels for most customers across PC, mobile, auto, and industrial end
markets. Consequently , the demand that we see from customers in these markets is
closer to their end-market demand. Data center customer inventory of memory and
storage is improving, and we continue to expect customer inventory to approach
normal levels in this market sometime in the ﬁrst half of calendar 2024. Across our
data center and PC markets, we are ahead of the industry in our transition to D5 and
we expect to cross over our D5 volume from D4 in early calendar 2024.
Generative AI use cases are expanding from the data center to the edge, with
several recent announcements of AI-enabled PCs, smartphones with on-device AI
capabilities, as well as embedded AI in the auto and industrial end markets. The
proliferation of on-device AI at the edge of fers a host of beneﬁts such as enhanced
privacy , lower latency , improved performance, greater personalization and
competitive costs for a wide range of use cases, from content creation to productivity .
We see a rapid evolution in our customer product roadmaps enabling and leveraging
this AI market expansion, which in turn is driving higher capacity , lower power , and
increased performance requirements for memory and storage. W e expect to
increasingly beneﬁt from content growth as these trends in AI gain momentum.
In data center , total server unit shipments are expected to increase by a mid-single-
digit percentage in calendar 2024, following a year of low-double-digit percentage
decline in calendar 2023. Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center
infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI
servers. Also, in response to AI-driven data center demand, several customers have
announced aggressive roadmaps for new GPU and AI accelerator ASIC product
introductions with increasing requirements for HBM capacity , performance, and
power .
Micron is addressing these exciting opportunities brought on by the proliferation of AI
with an industry-leading portfolio of data center solutions, including HBM3E, D5,
several types of high-capacity server memory modules, LPDRAM, and data center
SSDs. W e have received very positive customer feedback on our HBM3E, which has
approximately 10% better performance and about 30% lower power consumption
compared to competitive of ferings of HBM3E.
In ﬁscal Q1, we shipped samples of HBM3E to a number of key partners and are
making good progress in our qualiﬁcations. Micron is in the ﬁnal stages of qualifying
our industry-leading HBM3E to be used in NVIDIA's next-generation Grace Hopper
GH200 and H200 platforms. In addition, our LP5x is being used for the Grace CPU,
driving a new use case for LP  memory in the data center for accelerated computing.
We are on track to begin our HBM3E volume production ramp in early calendar 2024
and to generate several hundred millions of dollars of HBM revenue in ﬁscal 2024.
We expect continued HBM revenue growth in 2025, and we continue to expect that
our HBM market share will match our overall DRAM bit share some time in calendar
2025.
Last month we introduced the industry's fastest and lowest latency 128GB high-
capacity modules built on our industry-leading 1-beta node and using a monolithic
die, which does not require 3D stacking and thus enables a simpler process ﬂow for
assembly . Featuring best-in-class performance, our solution will support customers'
memory-intensive data center workloads today and into the future.
Additionally , leading CPU vendors have conﬁrmed validation support for our
monolithic-die-based 128GB modules on existing platforms released in 2022 and
2023 as well as upcoming new platforms. This ensures that our of fering has a
signiﬁcant TAM that we can address immediately . We expect volume production to
start next quarter , with signiﬁcant growth in ﬁscal 2025 and beyond.
A testament to our solid execution and superior of ferings, Micron ended the third
calendar quarter with record-high revenue share in data center SSDs based on
independent industry assessments. This marks the second consecutive quarter of
record revenue share in data center SSDs, and we look to build on this revenue
momentum through ﬁscal 2024.
In PCs, we forecast unit volumes to grow by a low- to mid-single-digit percentage in
calendar 2024, after two years of double-digit percentage PC unit volume declines.
We expect PC OEMs to start ramping AI-on-device PCs in the second half of
calendar 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB to 8GB of DRAM per unit, and we
see average SSD capacities increasing as well. W e also completed qualiﬁcations for
our industry-leading 1-beta-based 16GB D5 at several PC customers in ﬁscal Q1.
In ﬁscal Q1, we achieved record bit shipments in both client and consumer SSDs, as
customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Building upon our QLC leadership,
our client SSD QLC bit shipments also reached a new record in ﬁscal Q1. QLC now
comprises the majority of our bit shipment mix for both client and consumer SSD.
This month, we also announced that we are shipping the Micron 3500 NVMe SSD,
the world's ﬁrst performance client SSD with 200 plus layer NAND. Built on our
industry-leading 232-layer NAND, the 3500 will help our customers handle
demanding workloads for business applications, scientiﬁc computing, gaming, and
content creation.
In mobile, smartphone demand is showing signs of recovery , and we forecast
smartphone unit shipments to grow modestly in calendar 2024. Leading chipset
vendors have announced powerful new products supporting on-device large
language models with 10 billion or more parameters. W e expect smartphone OEMs
to start ramping AI-enabled smartphones in 2024, with an additional capacity of 4GB
to 8GB of DRAM per unit.
Longer-term, many popular generative AI applications will be on smartphones, and
our leading product portfolio is poised to capture this memory and storage
opportunity . Our new industry-leading 9.6Gbps LP5x will address the bandwidth
requirements of the most demanding AI-based mobile applications. W e also began
sampling our next-generation 232-layer NAND UFS 3.1 and our 1-beta DRAM 24Gb
LP5x to support the memory needs of emerging AI foundational models.
Last, I'll cover auto and industrial, which are end markets we value as part of the
portfolio due to their relatively more predictable revenue and proﬁtability and long-
term growth opportunity . The proliferation of AI at the edge continues to increase in
the industrial and auto markets. For memory , this translates to content growth in a
host of AI-enabled edge devices. For example, AI-enabled industrial PCs have 3x to
5x more memory than standard PCs and there is an 8x increase in memory content
for AI-enabled edge video security cameras compared to standard non-AI video
cameras.
Our automotive business achieved a new quarterly revenue record in ﬁscal Q1,
driven by better demand and volume ramps of new vehicle platforms. As a leader in
automotive market share and quality , Micron will beneﬁt from memory and storage
content growth as automotive OEMs expand features in ADAS and in-cabin
applications. Our automotive design win trajectory remains strong.
Our industrial business saw double-digit sequential growth in ﬁscal Q1 as the
industrial market continued to recover . Inventory levels for memory and storage
continued to improve at distribution partners and are at normal levels at the majority
of our customers. Industry fundamentals remain strong for memory and storage as
the widespread adoption of IoT , AI, and machine learning solutions creates new
growth opportunities for us.
Now turning to our market outlook, starting with demand. W e expect calendar 2023
DRAM bit demand to grow in the high-single-digit percentage range, up from prior
expectations for mid-single-digit growth. In NAND, we continue to expect calendar
2023 bit demand growth in the high-teens percentage range. Looking forward, over
the next few years, we expect bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and
low-20s percentage range in NAND. W e forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth
for the industry to be near the long-term CAGR for DRAM and somewhat below the
long-term CAGR for NAND.
Turning to supply , signiﬁcant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the
recovery that is now underway . An extended period of supply growth less than
demand growth would strengthen the pace of recovery . Micron will continue to
exercise supply and CapEx discipline, aligned with our strategy to maintain our long-
term bit market share for DRAM and NAND. Micron's ﬁscal 2024 CapEx is projected
to be between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, slightly higher than last year's levels and
prior plans, primarily to support the HBM3E production ramp. W e continue to expect
WFE CapEx in ﬁscal 2024 to be down year-over-year .
As we have discussed previously , the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply
growth in non-HBM products and will help improve the overall DRAM industry
supply-demand balance. Across the industry , the HBM3E die is roughly twice the
size of equivalent capacity D5. Additionally , the HBM product includes a logic
interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack that impacts
yields. These factors result in HBM consuming more than 2 times the wafer supply
as D5 to produce a given number of bits.
In last quarter's earnings call, we communicated that we strategically diverted
underutilized equipment toward ramping new technology nodes, which will help us
increase leading-edge production in a capital-efﬁcient manner . Since the number of
wafer processing steps is higher for leading-edge nodes, this approach of diverting
underutilized tools to the leading edge meaningfully reduces our overall wafer
capacity . Thus, underutilization in our fabs early this ﬁscal year transitions to
structurally lower wafer capacity at higher utilization rates as we move through the
ﬁscal year . Reports indicate that this redeployment of underutilized tools at the
leading edge is an industry-wide practice that is likely to constrain industry supply in
2024.
Taking all these factors into account, Micron's bit supply growth in ﬁscal 2024 is
planned to be well below demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect
to decrease our days of inventory in ﬁscal year 2024. W e expect calendar 2024
industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and NAND, which will result in a
contraction of industry inventory levels. As we have highlighted before, we continue
to work with the US government and CHIPS grants are assumed in our CapEx plans
for ﬁscal 2024. The viability and global competitiveness of our Idaho and New York
projects depends on Micron receiving CHIPS grants to address the cost dif ference
compared to overseas expansion.
To better support our customers around the globe, we have opened state-of-the-art
assembly and test facilities in Malaysia and Taiwan. W e are proceeding with our
previously announced expansion of our Xi'an facility , having received approval from
Chinese authorities for our planned investment. In ﬁscal Q1, we achieved the ﬁrst
mobile customer qualiﬁcation of LPDRAM assembled at our Xi'an site, furthering our
strong commitment to serve our mobile customers in China.
Our broad, diverse network of global operations remains a key element of our
strategy to address customer demand in a reliable and resilient fashion. Our leading
technology , strengthening product portfolio, strong manufacturing capabilities, and
our dedicated team members position us well to capture the opportunities ahead.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in
ﬁscal Q1 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS higher than the upper end of the
guidance range we provided in our last earnings call. During the quarter , an
improving supply-demand environment and our team's strong execution resulted in
higher prices across DRAM and NAND. The current pricing trajectory has improved
our ﬁnancial outlook for the second quarter and full ﬁscal year .
Total ﬁscal Q1 revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, up 18% sequentially and up
16% year-over-year . Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $3.4 billion, representing 73% of
total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 24% sequentially , with bit shipments
increasing in the low-20s percentage range and prices increasing in the low-single-
digit percentage range.
Robust bookings entering the quarter , including customer strategic buys that
occurred in prior quarters for ﬁscal Q1 shipment, limited our reported ﬁscal Q1
DRAM price increases despite Micron's strong execution on CQ4 pricing. Our strong
calendar Q4 price execution contributes to our solid sequential growth in ﬁscal Q2,
even with the ef fect of seasonality .
Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing 26% of Micron's total
revenue. NAND revenue increased 2% sequentially with pricing more than of fsetting
an expected and communicated decline in volumes. Bit shipments declined in the
mid-teens percentage range after record shipments in the prior quarter , and prices
increased by approximately 20%. Portfolio mix improvements in NAND contributed to
the increase.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $1.7 billion, up 45% sequentially . Data center and client shipments
strengthened in the quarter . AI-related shipments increased in the data center market
and normalized inventory at client customers enabled bit shipment growth.
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially . Mobile
revenue continued to show strength as customer inventories normalized and
smartphone units and average memory and storage capacity growth at customers
drove demand. Our mobile ﬁscal Q1 revenue almost doubled from year-ago levels.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1 billion, up 21% sequentially . Growth was
strong across most end markets. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $653
million, down 12% sequentially due to sharply lower consumer component sales,
partially of fset by strong growth in SSD revenue.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q1 was near 1%, improving 10 percentage
points sequentially and driven by higher prices and a greater mix of DRAM products.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q1 were $992 million, up $150 million sequentially and
in line with our late November update. OpEx increased on higher R&D expenditures
and the reinstatement of certain compensation programs suspended in the prior
ﬁscal year including short-term incentive compensation.
We had an operating loss of $955 million in ﬁscal Q1, resulting in an operating
margin of negative 20%, improved from negative 30% in the prior quarter . Fiscal Q1
taxes were $59 million, lower than the anticipated $80 million based on an updated
view of projected taxes across the year , driven by our improved ﬁscal 2024 outlook.
The non-GAAP  loss per share in ﬁscal Q1 was $0.95 compared to a non-GAAP  loss
per share of $1.07 in the prior quarter and a non-GAAP  loss per share of $0.04 in the
year-ago quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending, our operating cash ﬂows were
approximately $1.4 billion in ﬁscal Q1 representing 30% of revenue. During the
quarter , we received $600 million in customer prepayments to secure supply for
leading-edge memory products. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion during the
quarter resulting in free cash ﬂow of negative $333 million in the quarter .
Our ﬁscal Q1 ending inventory was $8.3 billion or 159 days, down from 170 days in
the prior quarter . As mentioned in prior quarters, we hold strategic inventory stock
associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation.
Excluding strategic stock, our ﬁscal Q1 ending inventory days would be
approximately 142 days, only 22 days higher than our target inventory level.
On the balance sheet, we held $9.8 billion of cash and investments at quarter end
and maintained $12.3 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility .
We ended the quarter with $13.5 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a
weighted average maturity on our debt of 2030.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal second quarter . While we remain mindful of
macroeconomic risks, the memory and storage market environment is improving. W e
expect supply-demand balance to tighten in both DRAM and NAND throughout 2024.
Our leading-edge DRAM and NAND nodes are oversubscribed for the full year .
Consequently , we expect prices to increase through calendar 2024, driving
improvements in our ﬁnancial performance.
Our leading-edge inventory is very tight, and we are also working to minimize pull-in
of customer demand in response to higher pricing. As a result, our sequential growth
in the near term will be driven primarily by pricing rather than a sequential increase in
bit shipments. Both DRAM and NAND bit shipments are expected to decline
somewhat in the ﬁscal second quarter .
We expect our ﬁscal Q2 gross margin to beneﬁt from sequential price increases and
reduced impact from underutilization. W e project the balance of previously written-
down inventories to clear in ﬁscal Q2. W e forecast operating expenses to decline in
the ﬁscal second quarter on lower R&D program expenses and an asset sale
previously expected to occur in the ﬁrst quarter .
For the ﬁscal year , due to some higher R&D expenses including what we saw in Q1
and higher short-term incentive compensation from an improved outlook, we now
project OpEx to be over $3.9 billion. W e forecast a much reduced operating loss in
ﬁscal Q2 and project a return to operating income in Q3.
Our tax forecast for the year has increased from under $200 million to over $300
million based on an updated taxable income outlook. W e project the allocation of tax
expense across the year to be heaviest in the fourth quarter driven by proﬁtability
and other factors. As we've mentioned previously , at current levels of proﬁtability , tax
estimates and the distribution of taxes across the year are highly sensitive to
changes in the outlook. W e plan ﬁscal Q2 capital expenditures to be in line with ﬁrst
quarter levels. W e see operating cash ﬂows improving substantially in the second-
half of the ﬁscal year and are now forecasting positive free cash ﬂow in the ﬁscal
fourth quarter .
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q2 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in
the range of 13%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $950 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax expenses of
approximately $45 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion
shares, we expect a loss of $0.28 per share, plus or minus $0.07.
In closing, the industry environment is improving, and our ﬁnancial outlook has
strengthened for the ﬁscal year and beyond. W e will continue to take a disciplined
approach to managing the business and remain focused on optimizing price, driving
productivity , and controlling capital spend. With high levels of liquidity and low net
leverage, we continue to operate from a position of balance sheet strength as we
forecast a return to proﬁtability and positive free cash ﬂow .
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. Over the last year , our world-class technology , business, and
manufacturing teams ensured ongoing leadership in foundational memory
technologies and the expansion of our industry-leading product portfolio. W e are
encouraged by the progress we have made on pricing, and we are on track to
restore proﬁtability more commensurate with the great value our solutions provide to
our customers.
We expect 2024 to be a year of recovery and can see the path towards a healthy
supply-demand environment along with strong growth in critical new technologies
like HBM3E. From the data center to the edge, AI has emerged as a signiﬁcant
secular driver that will further bolster the industry towards record revenue TAM in
2025 and drive growth for years to come. Micron's broad and growing suite of
leading-edge products positions us well to capitalize on the immense opportunities
ahead.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . [Operator Instructions] And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Krish
Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Sanjay or Mark, the ﬁrst question I had is
kind of you spoke about sustainability of pricing in calendar '24. I'm kind of curious if
you can peel the onion one layer below and say how we think about pricing through
calendar '24 for DRAM and NAND, and if you can extrapolate it into 2025, that'll be
very helpful. And then I had a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thanks, Krish for the question. And with respect to the pricing, we of course expect
pricing to continue to strengthen during calendar 2024. And this is because of the
healthy demand-supply balance as we discussed in the context of our script. As you
have seen, there have been signiﬁcant cuts in supply growth in the industry .
Customer inventories have normalized, supplier inventories are improving, as we
have discussed our own inventory here as well. And pricing will continue to improve
as a result through the course of the year .
And of course, you know , the demand trends overall, because of improvement of
customer inventories are in PCs, in smartphones, automotive and industrial, the
demand trend will continue. And in sometime in ﬁrst half of '24, calendar '24, we
expect data center inventories at customers to get normalized as well. And beyond
that point, we would expect data center to become another boost in demand in 2024.
So we expect pricing to continue to increase both in NAND and in DRAM as well.
And we expect a healthy demand-supply environment in 2025 as well as a healthy
pricing environment in '25 too.
And I just want to point out that as we noted, we have tightness on our leading-edge
nodes. They are already in short supply and inventories will continue to improve for
us. And all of this results in overall healthy dynamics for pricing improvements,
proﬁtability improvements, and revenue opportunity growth in the backdrop of
demand drivers, AI being a dominant demand driver across the end markets.
Krish Sankar
Got it. That's very helpful, Sanjay . And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx. I
understand a lot of the CapEx is going towards HBM and WFE is going to be down
year-over-year . Is there a way of quantifying how much of the CapEx for next year is
for HBM? And at -- what is the catalyst for you to start investing in NAND? Is it price?
Is it gross margin? Any such catalyst for NAND. That'd be very helpful. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we are not breaking down the CapEx, you know , between HBM and other parts of
the business, but we have noted that our WFE is down, and of course, we are very
much focused on supporting the growth of our HBM business. W e are very excited
about our leading-edge product, HBM3E, which is the most advanced HBM3E
offering in the industry . And we are -- as we noted in our remarks, post the
qualiﬁcation, you know , we are going to be starting production ramp early in calendar
'24 and driving revenue growth will be more back half loaded for us. So -- I mean, we
will of course make the necessary investments to support the demand for our HBM in
'24. I would just point out that our HBM supply is basically in calendar year '24 is sold
out at this point.
And, you know , in terms of, you know , NAND and CapEx, whether in NAND or in
DRAM, what's most important is that the proﬁtability returns to the levels that are
really needed in order to justify ROI in increasing any CapEx investments. So this is
what we are focused on and we'll remain extremely disciplined with respect to any
CapEx, with respect to any supply growth considerations. And you know that the
proﬁtability in the industry is still far from the levels that are needed to get ROI on the
investments and we plan to remain extremely disciplined in this regard.
Krish Sankar
Thanks, Sanjay .
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of
Aaron Rakers from W ells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, real quick. You know , ﬁrst,
building on the HBM comment that you're basically sold out for the year . I know that
you referenced in your prepared remarks that you're qualiﬁed in with the GH200 and
the H200 at NVIDIA. I'm just curious, when you get qual-ed in on HBM3E, you know ,
how does that market work in terms of -- you know , do these customers dual qualify?
Do you have line of sight and kind of your share position within those product SKUs?
I'm just curious of how the qualiﬁcations work and the visibility that you have to
basically kind of, you know , double down on the fact that you expect to be kind of,
you know , comparable market share in HBM as DRAM in total as you look out into
'25.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So our product is in qualiﬁcation, as we noted in our comments here, and
qualiﬁcation is progressing well. And post qualiﬁcation, we expect to be ramping
production volumes as well as shipments to our customers. And that's what will yield
to several hundred millions of dollars of revenue for us in ﬁscal year '24. Again, that
revenue will be more back half of our ﬁscal year , more so in the back half. But that
volume ramp and that revenue opportunity will continue to build up as we go into '25.
It will continue to increase in our ﬁscal year as well as calendar year '25.
And as we have said that sometime in calendar year '25, we expect to be able to get
to a level of our share in the HBM market that would align with our share in DRAM.
So this is an exciting opportunity for us. And as you know , HBM is higher revenue per
gigabyte. It is also higher proﬁtability per gigabyte. So this is -- and it's one of the
biggest growth markets in memory today . So we are excited about this opportunity .
And of course, you know , there's a very tight relationship, tight integration with
customers for quals on HBM. And it takes longer than standard products. And, you
know , these are all factors that will play a role in terms of, you know , the number of
suppliers that customers would tend to have for any given platform for HBM.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, I'm curious, in the comment you had said that
basically your leading-edge inventory was very tight. And I think the follow-up
comment was that you're really , you know , focusing on minimizing any pull-in in the
midst of, you know , pricing increases materializing. Can you just help us appreciate
what exactly you're able to do to minimize any pull-in or the visibility you have in
whether any customers are taking strategic inventory? Just curious how you manage
that.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to strategic inventory , I think we had discussed in the past that we
had made certain strategic -- certain customers had built certain strategic purchases
in our FQ4 time frame and those are completing in CQ4 here. And of course, as we
look ahead, we are very much focused on, you know , managing our supply ,
managing our demand. Pricing environment is increasing and we want to in this
environment, of course, make sure that we meet the requirements of our customers
in a fashion that overall maintains, you know , healthy dynamics of our business.
Beyond that, I don't think we are in a position to discuss further speciﬁcs here.
Aaron Rakers
Fair enough. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of
Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari
Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions as well. One on gross margins, maybe for
Mark, and then my follow-up is for Sanjay . Mark, so the gross margin proﬁle is
improving from, you know , breakeven or 1% in the prior quarter to 13%. I was hoping
you could sort of break that down, the sequential change for us in terms of pricing, I
guess lower underutilization charges, and whatever else is happening from an
inventory perspective. And beyond Feb, as we sort of look out into May , you talked
about pricing improving throughout '24, so that continues to be a tailwind. How
should we think about some of the other dynamics that go into your gross margin
math?
Mark Murphy
Sure. Excuse me. So on the fourth quarter to the ﬁrst quarter gross margin, you
know , we were up 10 points over half, or about half of that was price. Most of the
remainder was mix on the higher DRAM volumes. And then we did see some
favorable cost. W e had the lower-cost inventories clear at $600 million and then we
had some reduced idle charges that we've talked about.
Now, if we move out to second quarter , as we mentioned, we're not seeing volume
growth in the second quarter , but we are seeing gross margins still up 12 points. So
it's all driven by price, or principally price. There is some mix shift within, you know ,
by customers and some seasonal ef fects, but again, it's largely a price-driven
increase. You know , while we have lower beneﬁts from the low-cost inventory
clearing, we'll have $400 million clear or $400 million of beneﬁt in the second quarter
when we had $600 million in the ﬁrst quarter .
We are seeing some cost declines occurring with the increase of leading node
production, and then again with the lower wafer starts and the higher utilization.
What we've talked about before, we start to see idle charges dropping, as we've
discussed. So again, principally price in the second quarter , but then beginning to
see some cost beneﬁts, even though we're losing the beneﬁt of that lower cost
inventory .
We will see price appreciation through the year . We're going to -- we don't expect
there to be volume growth in the third quarter either , but good price appreciation,
which will drive gross margins up. And then in the fourth quarter , we would expect to
see volume and price, and again some lower utilization charges. So again, we would
expect to see margin expansion second quarter to third quarter , and then again third
quarter to fourth quarter .
Toshiya Hari
Okay . Great. That's super helpful. And then, as my follow-up for Sanjay , you know ,
you guys had presented a, you know , cross-cycle ﬁnancial model at your Investor
Day, I think it was last May . Clearly , the environment has changed quite a bit. But
when you sort of, you know , talk about necessary ROI for your business, as you guys
debate when to increase production, when to increase CapEx, should we look at the
model from last May still as a reference point, you know , through cycle operating
margins of 30%, free cash ﬂow margins of 10% or higher? Is that still the model
that's relevant in your view , or have things changed since? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes, that model is very much relevant once we get past this downturn and the
recovery from this downturn as well. And I think we just have to recognize that this
downturn has been steep. This has been driven by once in 100 year pandemic as
well as all the other related factors which we have talked about, customer inventories
and demand pull-in and demand normalization and all other things that have
impacted -- severely impacted the industry environment over the course of last year .
2024, we'll be recovering and we have called it the year of recovery . And we have
talked about how we see pricing continuing to increase through the year and of
course, proﬁtability continuing to improve through the year as well. As we look past
this recovery , we would deﬁnitely say that cross-cycle model that we have discussed
in the past deﬁnitely would hold and that's what we target for .
Toshiya Hari
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of
Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I had a question on these prepays that you're getting. That's $600
million. That's a pretty big number . So is that more of a one-time deal or should we
expect these, you know , prepays to continue? And as part of that, is that mostly
related to say HBM or a particular vertical like data center or is that across, you
know , most of your end markets? And then I had a follow-up as well.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So obviously , due to the conﬁdential nature of this agreement, we cannot provide any
speciﬁcs around these prepayments. But what I would like to point out is that it does
reﬂect the importance of our technology , our products, and our delivery capabilities. It
also reﬂects our close relationships with our partners and, you know , commitment
from both sides from our -- a good example of commitment from customers as well
as from Micron. Beyond that, I'm not able to really provide any speciﬁcs here. And
again, honoring the conﬁdentiality .
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . Okay , got that. I guess then can you talk, Sanjay , just about limiting the bit
shipments? I think you said you're limiting the bit shipments to prevent pull-ins ahead
of price increases. Sounds like bits are ﬂat sequentially for ﬁscal Q2 and ﬁscal Q3.
Can you talk about the logistics of that? Are you just kind of holding back on volumes
to regain some, you know , pricing leverage? I guess if your competitors don't match
that approach, you might risk losing some shares. So can you just talk about the
logistics of that? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, as we noted that leading-edge supply is already tight. And, you know , so that,
you know , certainly impacts in our FQ2, some of the shipments. FQ2, of course, is
also impacted by seasonality . And -- so supply is -- managing supply , given the tight
environment of supply on the leading nodes, is really the main consideration in terms
of us guiding you to this proﬁle. And of course, as we manage, as we allocate that
supply across the customers, we want to make sure that we are managing our
shipments to our customers carefully .
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . Thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi
Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow ups. Sanjay , historically , memory
industry tends to gravitate towards higher-margin products, which has historically led
to margin erosion. Why is HBM any dif ferent? And what are your thoughts? Anything
you can share with us as to what can preserve the higher margin associated with
these high-end products? And I have a follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
I think, you know , AI is in very early innings. Gen AI is barely starting and these are
great growth opportunities ahead. You know , this is, you know , biggest revolution
since Internet and recently you have heard industry estimates of data center AI
accelerator TAM CAGR of being about 70% over the course of next few years. Of
course, as those opportunities grow with data center accelerators, you know , from
various suppliers, of course, the whole infrastructure grows and it's about AI and Gen
AI applications from training to inferencing and really proliferating all across, you
know , the data center environment. And that's where -- and along with the growth in
data center AI accelerators, the rest of the infrastructure, including HBM, will
continue to grow .
So we project that HBM CAGR will be over 50% over the course of next few years.
And when you think about it, that is more than 3 times of the DRAM industry CAGR
that we are talking about. And still, we are in the very , very early innings. 2023 is the
ﬁrst year of meaningful shipments of HBM in the industry and that too corresponds to
low-single-digit percentage in terms of bits shipped in HBM this year , but much
higher pricing, much higher revenue opportunity . So as we look ahead, we see HBM
continuing to grow strongly in the industry . Its demand will grow . It will be a key
enabler of Gen AI applications in training as well as inferencing because more and
more data is required. As you look at more and more, larger and larger large
language models, and more training on more data just drives more demand for high
bandwidth, high performance, low power memory . So this is the very beginning. It
has long ways to go.
And the other important factor with HBM, as we have discussed is, that it really takes
more than 2 times as many wafers to produce the same number of bits as D5. So it
really has -- it is a headwind to the supply growth in the DRAM industry and it has the
effect of helping strengthen the supply-demand balance of the industry as well. So I
think these are, you know , some of the important aspects.
Of course, when -- so important thing is that this has to be looked at as a long-term
opportunity , long-term growth opportunity . And of course, you know , we are excited
about getting our HBM share to align with our DRAM share some time in 2025. And
of course, as we look at any large opportunity , you know , over time, it will certainly
have some ebb and ﬂow in terms of demand and supply and we will prudently
manage this. And maintaining ﬂexibility in managing this is absolutely key . And you
have seen us manage this well over time in our overall industry for DRAM as well as
for NAND on part of Micron, and we'll continue to manage it in that fashion. It is an
exciting opportunity . We are well positioned with our product and we look forward to
continuing to grow revenue and proﬁt contribution with this product line over the
course of next few years.
Mehdi Hosseini
Great. Thanks for detail. Just a quick follow-up for Mark. Is there a normalized capital
intensity that we should think of, especially as we come of f this kind of nuclear winter
in memory? Is there any -- if you don't have a normalized capital intensity , what else
out there that could help us better forecast free cash ﬂows?
Mark Murphy
Yes, no update, Mehdi, to the cross-cycle model that we've provided. So I think the
best way to think about CapEx is just over time as a percent of revenue, which we've
given mid 30s percent over time. Of course, you know , for example, HBM, you know ,
requires more CapEx, but it also yields a price premium and accretive margin. So we
believe that at this time that capital intensity model that we've provided before is still
intact.
Mehdi Hosseini
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of
Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned, your leading-
edge DRAM and NAND supply output is oversubscribed for the full year . Does you
factor in your CapEx plans, conversion of capacity from mature nodes to leading-
edge nodes? When do you guys see your ability to fully supply to your customers'
demand proﬁle? Is that looking more likely now calendar year '25 and what end
markets or applications are you seeing the largest demand-supply gap as you move
through the ﬁscal year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
As we move through the ﬁscal year , of course, you know , leading-edge nodes being
in tight supply . You know , leading-edge nodes are, you know , driver of demand in
PCs and smartphones and data center applications and we have a strong portfolio
that is well positioned with these nodes.
And -- so -- I mean, basically , this is important for us to maintain the supply discipline
and we -- industry is still not at the proﬁtability levels for investments to be made and
we'll manage our supply very , very prudently as we work ahead. And of course, we'll
continue to focus on driving the pricing as well as driving the proﬁtability of our
business to bring in return on investments on our CapEx that is needed and do our
best to manage and allocate the demand across our end markets and customers.
Harlan Sur
Great. Thanks for that. And again, you mentioned this brieﬂy in your prepared
remarks, but if you look at some of the third-party research estimates, September
quarter was the second consecutive quarter where the team had, I think, somewhere
about 10% to 12% market share in data center NVMe SSDs. If I look back
historically , like your share has been more in the sort of 3% to 5% range. So
obviously strong recent market share performance. You've got a strong lineup of data
center SSDs. What's been the big dif ferentiator for the team here and how do you
guys continue to grow your share going forward?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So thank you for acknowledging that. I mean, our team has done a great job with
data center SSD product portfolio over the course of the years and now we have a
strong set of product of ferings for , you know , data center SSDs, NVMe SSDs and we
now achieved record data center market share in SSDs for two consecutive quarters.
And for the calendar Q3, our data center SSD share now is in line with our NAND
share in the industry . And this is really the beneﬁt, and you're seeing the full beneﬁt,
the full power of vertical integration playing out here where our team has worked
together from device to design to ﬁrmware to system implementation to
understanding of customer application, working closely with customers in
qualiﬁcations and really across a wide range of customers over course of time, have
really developed very robust industry-leading, strong product portfolio with greater
opportunities ahead as well.
So, this is the transformation that we began to drive in the company , going from
selling components in the past to value-add solutions and really very pleased how
data center SSD recognition is being provided to our team in terms of revenue
opportunities by our customers and, you know , certainly reﬂected in the share gains
that we have made in this market.
And of course, another big factor that has been a key contributor to the success here
is you may recall we transitioned some time ago from ﬂoating gate to replacement
gate technology in NAND and that has deﬁnitely been a key factor . Strong,
successful, timely execution on that has played an important role in our data center
SSD strength. So we are very excited about Micron's market position in this market
and our future opportunities here.
Harlan Sur
Thank you, Sanjay .
Operator
