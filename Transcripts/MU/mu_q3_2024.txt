Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone.
I am pleased to report that Micron delivered ﬁscal Q3 revenue, gross margin, and
EPS, all above the high end of guidance ranges. Micron drove robust price increases
as industry supply-demand conditions continued to improve. This improved pricing,
combined with our strengthening product mix, resulted in increased proﬁtability
across all our end markets.
In data center , rapidly growing AI demand enabled us to grow our revenue by over
50% on a sequential basis, and we grew share in high-margin AI-related product
categories such as HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, and data center SSDs.
Our mix of data center revenue is on track to reach record levels in ﬁscal 2024 and to
grow signiﬁcantly from there in ﬁscal 2025. Robust AI-driven demand for data center
products is causing tightness on our leading-edge nodes. Consequently , we expect
continued price increases throughout calendar 2024 despite only steady near-term
demand in PCs and smartphones.
As we look ahead to 2025, demand for AI PCs and AI smartphones and continued
growth of AI in the data center creates a favorable setup that gives us conﬁdence
that we can deliver a substantial revenue record in ﬁscal 2025, with signiﬁcantly
improved proﬁtability underpinned by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin
products.
Micron is ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes in both DRAM and
NAND. Over 80% of our DRAM bit production is now on leading-edge 1-alpha and 1-
beta nodes. Over 90% of our NAND bit production is on our two leading-edge NAND
nodes. 1-gamma DRAM pilot production using extreme ultraviolet lithography is
progressing well, and we are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. Our
next-generation NAND node is on track, with high-volume production planned for
calendar 2025.
We experienced some operational disruptions after the recent Taiwan earthquake but
were able to recover quickly , thanks to diligent ef forts from Micron Taiwan team
members working together with our global operations teams. Despite impacts from
the earthquake, we now expect our ﬁscal 2024 DRAM front-end cost reductions,
excluding HBM, to be in the high single-digit percentage range. W e expect our ﬁscal
2024 NAND front-end cost reductions to be in the low-teens percentage range.
These cost reductions are supported by our industry-leading 1beta DRAM and 232-
layer NAND nodes.
During the quarter , Micron signed a nonbinding preliminary memorandum of terms,
or PMT , with the U.S. government for $6.1 billion in grants under the CHIPS and
Science Act. These grants support our planned leading-edge memory manufacturing
expansions in Idaho and New York. Federal and state incentives, projected power-
cost advantages and R&D co-location synergies will enable Micron to achieve cost-
competitive, leading-edge memory manufacturing in the United States when these
projects reach efﬁcient manufacturing scale.
Fab construction in Idaho is underway , and we are working diligently to complete the
regulatory and permitting processes in New York. This additional leading-edge
greenﬁeld capacity , along with continued technology transition investments in our
Asia facilities, is required to meet long-term demand in the second half of this decade
and beyond.
These investments support our objective to maintain our current bit share over time
and to grow our memory bit supply in line with long-term industry bit demand. Micron
retains ﬂexibility under the PMT  to manage construction and timing of supply growth
in a manner that allows us to remain responsive to market conditions.
Now turning to our end markets. W e are in the early innings of a multi-year race to
enable artiﬁcial general intelligence, or AGI, which will revolutionize all aspects of life.
Enabling AGI will require training ever-increasing model sizes with trillions of
parameters and sophisticated servers for inferencing. AI will also permeate to the
edge via AI PCs and AI smartphones, as well as smart automobiles and intelligent
industrial systems. These trends will drive signiﬁcant growth in the demand for
DRAM and NAND, and we believe that Micron will be one of the biggest beneﬁciaries
in the semiconductor industry of the multi-year growth opportunity driven by AI.
Most data center customer inventories have normalized, and demand from
customers continues to strengthen. PC and smartphone customers have built
additional inventories due to the rising price trajectory , the anticipated growth in AI
PCs and AI smartphones, as well as the expectation of tight supply as an increasing
portion of DRAM and NAND output is dedicated to meeting growing data center
demand. Due to expectations for continued leading-edge node tightness, we are
seeing increased interest from many customers across market segments to secure
2025 long-term agreements ahead of their typical schedule.
In data center , industry server unit shipments are expected to grow in the mid-to-high
single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers and a return to
modest growth for traditional servers. Micron is well positioned with our portfolio of
HBM, D5, LP5, high-capacity DIMM, CXL, and data center SSD products.
Recently , our customers have announced their long-term AI server product
roadmaps, with an annual cadence of new products with signiﬁcantly improved
capabilities for the next several years. Micron's technology and product leadership
puts us in an excellent position to support this growth.
Customers continue to provide feedback that our HBM3E solution has 30% lower
power consumption compared to competitors' solutions. Our HBM shipment ramp
began in ﬁscal Q3, and we generated over $100 million in HBM3E revenue in the
quarter , at margins accretive to DRAM and overall Company margins. W e expect to
generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in ﬁscal 2024 and
multiple billions of dollars in revenue from HBM in ﬁscal 2025. W e expect to achieve
HBM market share commensurate with our overall DRAM market share sometime in
calendar 2025.
Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024 and 2025, with pricing already contracted for
the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply . We are making signiﬁcant strides
toward expanding our HBM customer base in calendar 2025, as we design-in our
industry-leading HBM technology with major HBM customers.
We have sampled our 12-high HBM3E product and expect to ramp it into high-
volume production in calendar 2025 and increase in mix throughout 2025. W e have a
robust roadmap for HBM and are conﬁdent we will maintain our technology
leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E. Our next generations of HBM will provide further
performance and capacity enhancements while we continue to evolve our industry-
leading low-power innovations.
We achieved full validation on our 1-beta 32 gigabit monolithic-die-based 128
gigabyte high-capacity server DIMM products and are on track to achieve several
hundred million dollars of revenue from high-capacity DIMMs in the second half of
ﬁscal 2024. Additionally , we continue to see strong interest in our industry-leading 1-
beta LPDRAM in data center applications.
Data center SSD is in the midst of a strong demand recovery as customers have
worked through their 2023 inventory . Hyperscale demand is improving, driven
primarily by AI training and inference infrastructure, and supplemented by the start of
a recovery of traditional compute and storage infrastructure demand. Micron is
gaining share in data center SSDs as we reach new revenue and market share
records in this important product category .
During the quarter , we more than tripled bit shipments of our 232-layer-based 6500
30 terabyte SSDs, which of fer best-in-class performance, reliability , and endurance
for AI data lake applications. W e continued our leadership and innovation by
becoming the ﬁrst NAND vendor to supply 200-plus-layer QLC for the enterprise
storage market.
In PC, unit volumes remain on track to grow in the low single-digit range for calendar
2024. W e are optimistic that the planned Windows 10 end-of-life in 2025, the launch
of Windows 12, and the introduction of a new generation of AI PCs will accelerate the
PC replacement cycle starting in late calendar 2024. The PC replacement cycle
should gather momentum through calendar 2025 as new AI applications are rolled
out.
During Computex in Taiwan, we saw several announcements of next-generation
chipsets and AI PCs. These devices feature high-performance neural processing unit
chipsets, and we expect these devices will have 40% to 80% more DRAM content
than today's average PC. Microsoft's minimum system requirement for Copilot+ PCs,
such as the Surface Pro, is 16 gigabyte of DRAM. W e expect next-gen AI PCs to
make up a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025, growing each year
until most PCs ultimately support next-gen AI PC specs.
AI PCs are also likely to require higher performance and higher average capacity
SSDs than traditional PCs, aligning well with our leading technology portfolio on our
232-layer NAND with our performance 3500 SSD and our industry-leading value
QLC 2500 NVMe SSDs.
Turning to mobile. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to
grow in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range. Leading smartphone OEMs
recently announced new AI capabilities, and we are optimistic that delivering high-
quality AI experiences can accelerate the smartphone refresh cycle.
Smartphones have tremendous potential for personalized AI capabilities that of fer
greater security and responsiveness when executed on device. Micron's leading
LP5X is enabling the recent 12 gigabyte and 16 gigabyte AI phone releases at all
Android Tier 1 customers, representing a 50% to 100% increase over last year's
ﬂagship models.
Micron's leading mobile solutions provide the critical performance, capacity , and
power efﬁciency needed to unlock AI capability . Our mobile DRAM and NAND
solutions are now widely adopted in industry-leading ﬂagship smartphones. In
calendar Q1, we received recognition for being Number One in quality by ﬁve of the
world's leading smartphone OEMs. Qualiﬁcations are on track for our second-
generation 1-beta LP5X products, and we see broadening use of our 232-layer
NAND, moving beyond ﬂagship phones into high-capacity high-and mid-tier phones.
Turning to auto and industrial. The automotive sector continued to experience robust
demand for memory and storage, and Micron achieved a record quarter for
automotive revenues. Car production volumes are returning to pre-pandemic levels,
and broader adoption of intelligent digital cockpits and more advanced driver-
assistance capabilities are driving content growth.
We anticipate further content growth as additional intelligence, including generative
AI-based technologies, is adopted in vehicles. Micron continues to be a leader in
automotive with high-quality and industry-ﬁrst product introductions. In the ﬁscal third
quarter , we launched the world's ﬁrst multiport Gen 4 NVMe SSD in support of next-
generation centralized compute architectures.
In industrial and retail consumer segments, which are a smaller part of our business,
we are seeing some near-term demand uncertainty from our distribution partners and
end customers. W e remain conﬁdent in the long-term fundamentals and growth
drivers of these businesses, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in a variety
of applications.
Now, turning to our market outlook. W e forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth
for the industry to be in the mid-teens percentage range for both DRAM and NAND.
Over the medium term, we expect industry bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens
in DRAM and high teens in NAND.
Turning to supply . We expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for
both DRAM and NAND. As discussed previously , the ramp of HBM production will
constrain industry supply growth in non-HBM products. Industrywide, HBM3E
consumes approximately three times the wafer supply as D5 to produce a given
number of bits in the same technology node. With increased performance and
packaging complexity , across the industry , we expect this trade ratio for HBM4 to be
even higher than the trade ratio for HBM3E.
We anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI, combined with increasing silicon
intensity of the HBM roadmap, to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM
across all end markets. As the memory industry is still recovering from the
challenging environment in 2023, this tight supply environment will help drive the
considerable improvements in proﬁtability and ROI that are needed to enable the
investments required to support future growth.
Micron's bit supply growth in ﬁscal 2024 remains below our demand growth for both
DRAM and NAND. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline and
focus on improving proﬁtability while maintaining our bit market share for DRAM and
NAND. W e continue to project we will end ﬁscal 2024 with low double-digit
percentage less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND than our peak levels in
ﬁscal 2022. W e intend to use our existing inventory to drive a portion of the bit
growth supporting our revenue in ﬁscal 2025 to enable a more optimized use of our
CapEx investments.
Micron's ﬁscal 2024 CapEx plan will be approximately $8 billion, and WFE spending
will be down year-on-year in ﬁscal 2024. W e expect to increase our capital spending
materially next year , with CapEx around mid-30%s range of revenue for ﬁscal 2025,
which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end facility
construction as well as technology transition investment to support demand growth.
The construction CapEx in the planned Idaho and New York greenﬁeld fabs in ﬁscal
2025 will be half or more of the expected increase in total CapEx.
In fact, the growth in both greenﬁeld fab construction and HBM CapEx investments,
is projected to make up the overwhelming majority of the year-over-year CapEx
increase. These fab construction investments are necessary to support supply
growth for the latter half of this decade. This Idaho fab will not contribute to
meaningful bit supply until ﬁscal 2027, and the New York construction CapEx is not
expected to contribute to best supply growth until ﬁscal 2028 or later . The timing of
future WFE spend in these fabs will be managed to align supply growth with
expected demand growth.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone.
Micron delivered strong results in ﬁscal Q3 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS
above the high end of the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call.
Improving market conditions and strong price and cost execution drove the ﬁnancial
outperformance.
Total ﬁscal Q3 revenue was $6.8 billion, up 17% sequentially and up 82% year-over-
year. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was approximately $4.7 billion, representing 69% of
total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 13% sequentially , with bit shipments
declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range and prices increasing by
approximately 20%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was approximately $2.1 billion,
representing 30% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 32%
sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in the high single-digit percentage range
and prices increasing by approximately 20%.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $2.6 billion, up 18% sequentially . DRAM data center revenue more than
doubled year-over-year . Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.6 billion, down
1% sequentially as a planned decline in volume was partially of fset by improved
pricing.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.3 billion, up 16% sequentially driven by
record revenue in automotive. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.4
billion, up 50% sequentially with growth across all end markets. W e achieved record
data center SSD revenue, which nearly doubled sequentially .
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q3 was approximately 28%, up over 8
percentage points sequentially driven primarily by higher pricing and helped by
product mix and cost reductions. Excluding the ef fects of previously written-down
inventories on ﬁscal Q2 gross margin, the sequential improvement in ﬁscal Q3 would
have been 15 percentage points. As a reminder , previously written-down inventories
had no impact on ﬁscal Q3 gross margin and will not af fect our gross margin moving
forward.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q3 were $976 million, up $17 million quarter-over-
quarter . Continued spend discipline and ongoing operational efﬁciencies helped
deliver operating expenses at the low end of the guidance range.
We generated operating income of $941 million in ﬁscal Q3, resulting in an operating
margin of 14%, which was up 10 percentage points sequentially and up 53
percentage points from the year-ago quarter .
Fiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA  was $2.9 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of 43%,
up 6 percentage points sequentially and up 30 percentage points or $2.4 billion from
the year-ago quarter . Fiscal Q3 taxes were $227 million, lower than expectations at
the time of our guidance, driven by one-time discrete items.
Non-GAAP  diluted earnings per share in ﬁscal Q3 was $0.62, compared to $0.42 in
the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.43 in the year-ago quarter . Fiscal Q3
non-GAAP  EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.10, driven by
better revenue and proﬁtability .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending, our operating cash ﬂows were $2.5
billion in ﬁscal Q3, representing 36% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $2.1
billion during the quarter , and we generated free cash ﬂow of $425 million. Our ﬁscal
Q3 ending inventory was $8.5 billion or 155 days, a decline of ﬁve days from the
prior quarter . Our leading-edge supply continues to be very tight for both DRAM and
NAND.
On the balance sheet, we held $9.2 billion of cash and investments at quarter end
and maintained near $12 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit
facility . Considering our ample liquidity , return to free cash ﬂow generation, and
strong outlook, during the quarter , we repaid $650 million of debt maturing in
November 2025. W e ended the quarter with $13.3 billion in total debt, low net
leverage, and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal fourth quarter . We expect DRAM bit
shipments to be ﬂattish and NAND shipments to be up slightly in ﬁscal Q4. W e
forecast shipment growth to strengthen modestly in the November quarter . We
project continued gross margin expansion. Pricing trends remain positive, supported
by favorable supply-demand conditions.
Portfolio mix will be an important contributor over time as HBM, high-capacity
DIMMs, data center SSDs, and other high-value products increase as a portion of
our mix. The high mix for our leading-edge nodes supports front-end cost reductions
in line with our long-term cost-reduction CAGRs, excluding HBM on DRAM. Keep in
mind that higher mix of HBM will of fset non-HBM DRAM cost reductions, but HBM
will be at accretive gross margins.
We forecast operating expenses to increase sequentially in the ﬁscal fourth quarter
due to an increase in R&D program expenses and a nonrecurring Q3 asset sale gain
contemplated in our Q3 guidance. W e estimate ﬁscal Q4 tax expense of
approximately $320 million. For ﬁscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP  tax rate to
be in the mid-teens percent range.
We project days of inventory outstanding to decline through ﬁscal 2025 and DIO to
approach our target by the end of ﬁscal year 2025. W e forecast capital expenditures
to increase sequentially in the ﬁscal fourth quarter to approximately $3 billion.
Despite this increase in CapEx, we project continued positive free cash ﬂow in ﬁscal
Q4. W e expect full year ﬁscal 2024 CapEx of around $8 billion.
Record revenue and signiﬁcantly improved proﬁtability in ﬁscal 2025 will help support
average quarterly CapEx in ﬁscal 2025 to be meaningfully above the ﬁscal Q4 2024
level of $3 billion. W e expect CapEx around mid-30%s range of revenue for ﬁscal
2025, which will support HBM assembly and test equipment, fab and back-end
facility construction, as well as technology transition investment to support demand
growth.
As noted earlier , half or more of the expected CapEx increase in ﬁscal 2025 will be to
support U.S. greenﬁeld fab construction. As we have noted in the past, the CHIPS
grants, ITC, and state incentives of fset a signiﬁcant portion of the U.S. fab CapEx
investments.
Receipt of some of these incentive reimbursements occurs well after when we incur
the spend, resulting in higher CapEx for a period while we ramp our greenﬁeld U.S.
investments. Micron will remain disciplined in our capital spending and will modulate
our WFE investments to grow bit supply in line with industry demand.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for the ﬁscal Q4 is as follows.
We expect revenue to be $7.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be
in the range of 34.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.06 billion, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax expenses of
approximately $320 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion
shares, we expect EPS to be $1.08 per share, plus or minus $0.08.
In closing, market conditions are improving, with price increases driven by favorable
supply-demand trends and tightness on the leading edge. Micron is executing well
on leveraging our technology leadership to grow our mix of high-value solutions,
especially in products that support AI applications.
Finally , our leading-edge investments and productivity initiatives are delivering cost-
downs and operating leverage during this market recovery . We expect record
revenue and signiﬁcantly better proﬁtability in ﬁscal 2025 to support disciplined
investment to maintain stable bit share and deliver free cash ﬂow growth.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark.
I want to close by commending our team in Taiwan for their response to the
signiﬁcant earthquake in ﬁscal Q3. In many ways, that response exempliﬁes Micron,
an agile, prepared team that assesses and reacts quickly , supported by a brilliant
network of colleagues around the globe. That collaboration, planning, discipline, and
experience are precisely what ensures Micron is so well positioned today . I look
forward to our teams accelerating Micron's memory and storage leadership as AI
solutions present increasing opportunities to provide greater value, from data centers
to the edge.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . And one moment for our ﬁrst question. Our ﬁrst question comes from the
line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question, please.
Krish Sankar
Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. Sanjay , the ﬁrst one.
It's on HBM. Clearly , you're gaining traction in HBM3E. I'm just curious how the
HBM3E is, and how is the qualiﬁcation going beyond one customer? Last time, you
publicly said that you're qualiﬁed at NVIDIA's H200. I'm kind of curious, how is it
going with the B100 for NVIDIA? And also, along the same path, your competitors
spoke about pulling in the timeframe for HBM4 versus the regular 18-month cadence
for HBM technology transit system. So, basically , I'm curious, Sanjay , any comment
on HBM3E? Call a dif ferent customer , timing of HBM4 would help. Then I have a
quick follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, let me start of f by again pointing out that we delivered over $100 million in
revenue in ﬁscal Q3 with our HBM3E. And I'm very pleased with our team's focus on
this and delivering this number . And note that this was margin accretive to our overall
margins, but also to our DRAM margins. And of course, we remain very much
focused on delivering several hundred million dollars in ﬁscal 2024 for HBM revenue.
And as I noted, multiple billion dollars in revenue.
And in HBM, we are very much focused on continuing to ramp our production and
also to improve our yields. And that is, of course, an important priority . And any new
product that is as complex as HBM or any new technology node always has a yield
ramp, and the team is extremely focused on that.
So, as we look ahead to 2025, we remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver our
market share consistent with DRAM share some time in 2025. And again, very
pleased with Micron's strong product of HBM3E that, as I noted, has been well
recognized by our customers to have 30% better power than any competitor's
product that is out there.
Now, regarding your question on qualiﬁcations, of course, we are in qualiﬁcations
with other customers as well. And as I noted in my remarks, that in 2025 timeframe,
we expect to be broadening, diversifying our customer base as well. And HBM4, I
mentioned in my remarks that we have a strong roadmap ahead for HBM4 and
HBM4E. And we feel very good about our capabilities there, the roadmap that we
have in front of us, and our ability to deliver leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E as
well.
Krish Sankar
Got it. Thanks, Sanjay , for that. Another quick follow-up, on NAND, in this -- on the
NAND bit demand, you kind of mentioned that the bit growth -- demand bit growth is
going to be in the high teens. If I remember right, last quarter , you said it's going to
be in the low 20%s. So, I'm kind of curious, what was the delta since last few months
ago? Because there's a general view that AI should be helping NAND. So, why is the
NAND bit demand growth not going higher? Looks like it's going lower . Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, what I would tell you, Krish, is that there is really not much of a dif ference
between the CAGR that we shared last time versus the CAGR we shared here. And
I'll also tell you that we basically revised the base year for the CAGR that we used.
So, this time, the CAGR that we used, we used the base year of 2023. And in 2023,
as you know , we had a bit demand growth in NAND that was higher , meaningfully
higher than the CAGR. So, that, of course, the larger base of 2023 just somewhat
changed our outlook on the overall CAGR.
But you're absolutely right to note, as we have also highlighted, that data center
SSDs are a good growth demand driver . And I'll just provide you some color . The
data center , automotive, and industrial, these are all growing faster in terms of NAND
demand versus the CAGR that we have shared. Client, mobile, and consumer
somewhat slower .
But these slow-growing segments actually have also average capacity increases
ahead of them. As I gave you examples of AI PCs and AI smartphones driving
content growth. And we have just conservatively planned for this, perhaps. And we
will continue to assess the average capacity growth in smartphones and PCs in the
times ahead.
And it's important that the CAGR that we highlight here, this is what we use for our
capacity planning. And we want to, of course, always remain disciplined with respect
to our capacity planning and very much focusing on demand-supply balance and
ROI.
Krish Sankar
Got it. Thanks a lot, Sanjay . Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of V ivek Arya from Bank of
America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. Sanjay , you mentioned a 3x trade ratio of HBM to D5.
What happens to this ratio as you go to higher stacks, 12-high or more? And on the
other hand, what happens as you make yield improvements? Just overall, is 3x still
the operative assumption for calendar '25? And just what are the puts and takes
around this ratio?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes, I mean, I think for HBM3E, 3x here is the operative guidance here with respect
to the trade ratio. And again, just keep in mind that this already accounts for the
larger die that exists with HBM3E given its performance and packaging and overall
product expectations, as well as, of course, with the 8-die stack, as well as the logic
die in there, the mature yield expectations there as well.
And as the yield will be ramping up for us, of course, we will be able to get the
beneﬁt on the lower cost as we go forward. But with mature yields, the trade ratio
with HBM3E is about 3 times over the mature yields of D5 in the same technology
node.
And as you go up to HBM4, of course, the trade ratio, as we have said before,
increases and goes higher than 3x. And as you go up from 8-die stack to 12-die
stack in HBM3E, of course, 12-die stack will have somewhat lower mature yields as
well. That's just the nature of how device yields work. And -- but the operative
guidance, I think, remains still 3x for HBM3E and greater than that for HBM4,
inclusive of the assumption of mature yields. And, of course, our assumption of
mature yields here is world-class mature yields.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And a quick follow-up, maybe for Mark. So, you're suggesting ﬁscal '25 could
be a record in terms of sales. Why can't it be a record in terms of gross margins?
What are the puts and takes of gross margins as we go into next year? So, maybe
give us some sense of what incremental margins can be. Let's say sales are up $5
billion or $10 billion year-on-year , just so we can level-set our model from a gross
margin perspective. Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Yes, V ivek, we're happy to take that. W e're not providing ﬁscal year '25 guidance yet.
I can talk about some sequential improvements from here. Of course, we guided a
600 basis point increase gross margin guidance between third quarter and the guide
and fourth. And, yes, that's driven by price, but also mix is beginning to become a
more substantive factor in the sequential gross margin expansions.
We see November quarter , we see gross margin expansion continuing up a few
hundred basis points. Again, price is a factor , but also, as a fourth quarter mix,
participating in the -- or contributing to the increase. And that's the ef fect of HBM and
high-capacity DIMMs and other higher-value products.
We do expect through ﬁscal '25 for price to continue to increase, and we expect this
favorable mix ef fect to continue to increase. You've seen very clearly in the third
quarter and our fourth quarter guide, the strength in data center , and we see that
growth continuing. And then later in the year , we see replacement cycle for
smartphone and PC. And then the associated content with AI picking up. So, we
expect that to, again, second half of the calendar year in the early '25 for that to kick
in.
Then on the supply side, you've got just tight conditions. You've got structurally lower
capacity in the industry . Inventories are trending down, which we believe ours will
trend down through ﬁscal '25 to close to our target by the end of '25. And then just
the HBM trade ratio, which Sanjay just commented on.
And then, of course, I talked about in the sequential gross margin, talked about the
mix that we see in the business with our higher-value products, which are HBM,
high-capacity DIMMs, SSDs, which we've talked about. So, the momentum is very
strong. W e've got technology leadership. W e've got the best product position the
Company's ever had. And the manufacturing is operating very well. So, well-
positioned for ﬁscal '25.
Vivek Arya
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman
Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari
Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two as well. The ﬁrst one on
HBM, I guess recently there have been a couple of reports about you all having
some yield issues. Just based on your commentary , it didn't sound like you were
having these issues, but just wanted to clarify that. If you could address that, that
would be really helpful. And then on HBM, the second part is, so gross margins are
intuitive to overall corporate margins today . What are your thoughts on sort of relative
proﬁtability going into the second half of the year and into calendar '25, particularly
given the fact that you have pretty good visibility as it pertains to HBM pricing?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, regarding the yield, I think I already commented that we are pleased that in the
very ﬁrst quarter of production, we were able to ship over $100 million of HBM
revenue. And we remain focused on our goals and remain conﬁdent about our goals
of delivering several hundred million dollars of revenue in ﬁscal '24 and a multiple
hundred billions of dollars of revenue in ﬁscal '25 and getting to our share to be in
line with -- our share for HBM to be in line with our DRAM share sometime in 2025.
So, of course, our yield assumptions are baked in in all of that. And we look to
continue to work on all aspects of ramping up our capacity . And, of course, we
expect to improve yields as we go forward. Again, that is typical of any new
technology , any new product that you ramp up. So, that's what we remain focused
on.
And regarding the gross margin comment, maybe Mark can add some color . But as I
mentioned earlier , the gross margin is accretive not only for -- to our corporate
margins, but it is also accretive to our DRAM margins. And our DRAM margins, as
you know , tend to be higher than our corporate margins, which are lower because of
the lower margins in NAND, generally in the industry .
Mark Murphy
It is helping to drive continued gross margin expansion through '25.
Toshiya Hari
Okay . Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Mark on
CapEx. So, you're guiding ﬁscal year '25 up materially , given some of the hints that
you've provided, maybe you're looking at a mid-teens billion dollar number for ﬁscal
'25. I know more than half of that or half of that is coming from the greenﬁeld
investments in the U.S., but how should we be thinking about your bit supply growth
in ﬁscal '25 or calendar '25? Should we expect you guys to grow more or less in line
with the demand CAGR you have for DRAM and NAND, mid-teens and high-teens
respectively , or do you expect to undershift relative to those ranges in ﬁscal '25?
Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Yes, we -- good questions, Toshiya. And your view on CapEx, we've given enough
that we don't want to guide revenue for '25 because we -- we'll do that at a future
date by quarter . But we do expect a material increase year-over-year . For the
quarter , sequentially , we'll see a meaningful step up, and we were at $3 billion, we
increased from $2.1 billion to $3 billion third quarter to fourth quarter guide. I would
characterize that both on a dollar and percent basis as more than meaningful, so it
would be less than that sequentially . But we are spending more.
Yes, to your question on, we are very constrained on bits, bit production, and so we
will -- as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we will certainly see inventory levels
come down. In fact, we expect to be approaching target inventory levels by the end
of 2025.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And now our next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley from
Barclays. Your question, please.
Thomas O'Malley
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is for Sanjay or Mark. So, you've given
us the ﬁscal year '25 kind of Company guidance of several billion in HBM. And then
you've kind of talked about the share that you're getting to is equivalent to that of
DRAM. So, you kind of saw for that market low teens, total HBM market. I just kind of
want to understand, what's your view of the suppliers to that market? As it stands
today , it seems like there's really two major suppliers. When you look at the out year ,
do you think that number changes if there is additional qualiﬁcations? W ould that
number change if you were to have a third qualiﬁcation, aka, the market be bigger?
And how did you kind of come up with that total market number? Is that kind of a
bottoms-up accelerator forecast? But just kind of how you're thinking about the
market. And did that change or is it contingent upon qualiﬁcations of some of your
competitors?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, as we have said before, that we see the CAGR for HBM growth, in terms of bit
growth CAGR to be well above 50% over the next few years. So, certainly , HBM is a
strong growth driver . And again, as we increase our mix of HBM going forward, it will
of course be continuing to be accretive to our ﬁnancial performance, including
margins. And we are pleased that with the strong performance that we have, we are
sold out for '25 as well, with a overwhelming part of our output already committed in
terms of pricing.
So, that points to a strong position that we have in terms of continuing to work toward
achieving our goal of getting to our HBM market share to be in line with DRAM share
sometime in 2025. And of course, we are working with a broad range of customers,
in qualiﬁcations, and next year we plan to be shipping to broader set of customers.
Having said all of that, no question that HBM is a complex product for our customers
to qualify as well. It's highly resource intensive, not just for us, but for our customers
as well. And this is where we think that our strong product position, highlighting again
those attributes of 30% better power than nearest competitor , and a better
performance, and really high quality here positions us well when customers work
with those resource-intensive qualiﬁcations for Micron. And that's what we are
already seeing in terms of our engagement. So, we feel pretty good about our plans
here for HBM.
Thomas O'Malley
Super helpful. And then just switching gears over to the NAND side of things.
Obviously , you had a competitor out in the market talking about kind of run rate
industry CapEx and kind of talking about the change in industry architecture, maybe
not scaling as quickly or as capital intensively as you had in the past. You obviously
are talking about CapEx. A lot of your CapEx next year is going towards greenﬁeld
and HBM. Could you talk to the remainder of that CapEx? Could you give us any
color on DRAM or NAND split between that? And then do you agree with, in this
instance, it was W estern Digital talking about capital intensity longer term on the
NAND side? Do you agree that maybe structurally you'll see a lower investment
threshold in the future to kind of continue to maintain what the industry needs?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So, for us, certainly , our CapEx is dominated by our DRAM-related CapEx. That's
certainly HBM because it's growing as mixed in the industry and HBM is capital
intensive when it comes to unique clean room requirements for HBM and in
packaging and assembly as well as test equipment. So, our CapEx is dominated by
that, as well as to meet the future requirements in the second half of this decade.
And that involves the construction of the fab.
So, NAND CapEx is certainly a much smaller portion of our total CapEx. And we
have a very strong technology position with our NAND and strong portfolio that you
see. And we are continuing to shift that portfolio toward higher-value solutions as
well. So, we certainly will remain extremely disciplined when it comes to NAND as
well in terms of driving the CapEx.
And we will be disciplined in terms of driving our technology node transitions in the
timing of node transitions across the industry . I think it is certainly helpful given the bit
growth that you get from those transitions to slow down the timing of those -- the
cadence of those node transitions so that your bit growth CAGR versus the gain of
bits that you get from the wafers can be managed well.
These are the kind of things we are very much focused on in order to maintain a
good supply discipline, maintain supply growth that is very much in line with the
demand growth, and managing our CapEx here prudently . But yes, I mean overall
our CapEx is -- in NAND is signiﬁcantly smaller , but we remain extremely disciplined,
focused on managing our supply growth in line with demand there.
And again, I want to point out that with NAND, technology transitions are sufﬁcient to
meet the demand growth. W e do not need the new clean room, the new greenﬁeld
fabs, the kind that are needed in DRAM. And HBM and the trade ratio of HBM with
standard DRAM is a factor in the greenﬁeld requirements only , also.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Christopher Danely from Citi. Your question, please.
Christopher Danely
Hi, thanks, guys. So, I think you mentioned you are signing up some customers to
long-term contracts. Given your belief that the pricing is going to keep going up, why
sign people up to long-term contracts and potentially miss out on some of the
increased pricing? Or is there some potential for wiggle room on pricing with the
contracts and it is more of a unit basis? Just curious there.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, the long-term contracts really help us and customers get closer , not only with
respect to, let's say , supply or pricing discussions as may be relevant to our various
customer contracts, but also with respect to the technology roadmap, the product
roadmap, the timing of the supply . And they are very helpful factors in building a
close relationship with the customers.
And you can see that we are pointing to a substantial revenue record in 2025, of
course leveraging some of these contracts that we have put in place. And we have
also pointed to a signiﬁcant improvement in proﬁtability . So, I think we are well
positioned in these contracts with respect to not only the supply and demand
fundamentals, but also with respect to the ﬁnancial aspects.
Christopher Danely
Great. Thanks, Sanjay . And then just a quick one for Mark. Mark, was the Taiwan
quake impact limited to the May quarter , or is it impacting the current quarter as well?
Mark Murphy
Not a material impact, Chris.
Christopher Danely
It was just May . All right. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Your question, please.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Enterprise SSDs are seeing really
strong demand pull from AI workloads, right? The team has driven signiﬁcant share
gains in enterprise SSD just over the past few quarters. I think in calendar Q1, I think
Micron was the number three global share leader in enterprise SSD. I think it's now
about 20%, 25% of the overall NAND business. I mean, this is a position that we've
never seen Micron in before. So, I think ﬁrst question is, are enterprise SSD gross
margins accretive to your overall NAND gross margins?
And then secondly , I saw your next-gen PCIe Gen5 SSD demo at NVIDIA's GTC
conference. Pretty signiﬁcant performance uplift on AI workloads versus your Gen4
SSDs. So, are you qualifying these next-gen Gen5 SSDs for AI applications? When
do you expect to shift? Just wanted to understand the sustainability of your strong
share position here.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, thank you, Harlan, for recognizing the strong momentum that Micron's data
center SSD have. And certainly , our data center SSDs are accretive to our overall
NAND margins. And we have really great products. I already highlighted in my
prepared remarks that we saw tripling of bits that we shipped with our 32-layer
NAND AI SSDs going absolutely toward AI data center applications. And we have a
broad set of customers that we are working with in terms of growing our share.
So, we see -- when we talk about sequentially , we had 50% increase in revenue for
our data center products, of course, that includes the beneﬁt of our strong data
center SSD roadmap. And yes, I mean, we will, of course, continue to work with our
Gen5 SSDs in terms of working with customers for qualifying and not prepared to
discuss, at this point, speciﬁcs regarding timing of some of the roadmap that is in
front of us for shipments.
So, yes, in terms of sustainability of the strong improvement to share, we are
deﬁnitely with our strong product portfolio counting on it. And this will -- our SSD
momentum, data center SSD momentum, will absolutely contribute also toward my
remarks that I said that we will increase our mix of data center revenue in ﬁscal year
'25 as well. Of course, HBM, high-density DIMMs, these will, of course, be a big part
of it. But also, data center SSDs is going to be another big part of our growth in ﬁscal
2025 related to data center revenue.
Mark Murphy
So, I would just add, Harlan, that the storage business unit delivered operating proﬁt
in the quarter .
Harlan Sur
Perfect. Thank you very much. Insightful.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session, as well as today's
program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now
disconnect. Good day .
