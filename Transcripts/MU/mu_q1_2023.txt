Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered ﬁscal ﬁrst quarter
revenue and EPS within our guidance range despite the pricing environment, which
deteriorated signiﬁcantly from our prior call. The industry is experiencing the most
severe imbalance between supply and demand in both DRAM and NAND in the last
13 years.
Micron is exercising supply discipline by making signiﬁcant cuts to our CapEx and
wafer starts while maintaining our competitive position. W e are also taking measures
to cut costs and OpEx across the Company . Customer inventory , which is impacting
near-term demand, is expected to continue improving, and we expect most
customers to have reduced inventory to relatively healthy levels by mid-calendar
2023.
Consequently , we expect the ﬁscal second half revenue to improve versus the ﬁrst
half of our ﬁscal year . We expect our days of inventory to peak in our current ﬁscal
Q2 and gradually improve over the next few quarters as our bit shipments improve
and our supply growth is signiﬁcantly reduced.
Despite this improving bit shipment and revenue trajectory , we expect industry
proﬁtability to remain challenged through calendar 2023. The combination of our
technology leadership, manufacturing expertise, diverse product portfolio, a strong
balance sheet and our decisive actions provide a solid footing to navigate this
challenging near-term environment.
I'll start today with an overview of our technology position. Micron continues to lead
the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology . We are ﬁrst to market with 1-beta
DRAM and 232-layer NAND. While both on 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND of fer
strong cost reductions, we have slowed their ramps to better align our supply with
market demand, as we previously indicated.
Yield trajectory for these nodes is on track, and we are continuing to qualify these
nodes across our product portfolio and will be well positioned to ramp these nodes
when industry conditions improve. Our 1-beta DRAM node, which we introduced in
ﬁscal Q1 delivers around a 15% power efﬁciency improvement and more than 35%
bit density improvement versus 1-alpha. 1-beta will be used across our product
portfolio, including DDR5, LP5, HBM and graphics.
Now turning to our end markets, across nearly all of our end markets, revenues
declined sequentially in ﬁscal Q1 due to weaker demand and steep decline in pricing.
Shipment volumes were impacted by our customers' inventory adjustments, the
trajectory of their end demand and macroeconomic uncertainty .
We believe that aggregate customer inventory while still high, is coming down in
absolute volume as end market consumption outpaces shipping. In data center , we
expect cloud demand for memory in 2023 to grow well below the historical trend due
to the signiﬁcant impact of inventory reductions at key customers. End demand at
cloud customers is not immune to macroeconomic challenges, but should strengthen
once the economic environment improves.
DDR5 is extremely important for data center customers as the industry begins to
transition to this new technology in calendar Q1. As modern servers pack more
processing cores into CPUs, the memory bandwidth per CPU core has been
decreasing.
Micron D5 alleviates this bottleneck by providing higher bandwidth compared to
previous generations enabling improved performance and scaling. Feedback from
our customers across the x86, and ARM ecosystem suggests that Micron leads the
industry with the best D5 products. W e expect server D5 bit shipments to become
more meaningful in the second half of calendar 2023, with crossover expected in
mid-calendar 2024.
Building on our existing D5 products, in ﬁscal Q1, we began qualifying 1-alpha 24-
gigabit D5, and we announced availability of D5 memory for the data center that is
validated for the new AMD EPYC 9004 series processors. In addition, we are also
making progress on CXL, and in ﬁscal Q1, we introduced our ﬁrst CXL  DRAM
samples to data center customers.
In data center SSDs, we are continuing to proliferate our 176-layer SSD, and in ﬁscal
Q1, we nearly doubled the number of customers where we are qualiﬁed. W e have
also completed qualiﬁcation of our 176-layer QLC with an important enterprise
customer .
In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2022 units to decline in the high-teens percentage
and expect 2023 PC unit volume to decline by low to mid-single-digit percentage to
near 2019 levels. Client D5 adoption is expected to gradually increase through
calendar 2023, with crossover in mid-calendar 2024 and we are well positioned for
this transition with leading D5 products.
We also continue to lead the industry in QLC, and it is an important competitive
advantage for us. In ﬁscal Q1, client and consumer QLC SSDs had very strong
growth which helped increase our NAND QLC mix to a new record.
Earlier this month, Micron began shipping the world's most advanced client SSD,
featuring 232-layer NAND technology . As the world's ﬁrst client SSD to ship using
NAND over 200 layers, the Micron 2550 NVMe SSD demonstrates superior speed,
density and power savings enabled by our industry-leading NAND node.
In Graphics, we expect bit growth to outpace the broader market in calendar 2023.
Micron continues to drive the industry's fastest graphics memory with 24 gigabit per
second, 16-gigabit GDDR6X shipping in high-volume production.
In mobile, we now expect calendar 2022 smartphone unit volume to decline 10%
year-over-year versus our high single-digit percentage decline projection last
earnings call. W e forecast calendar year 2023 smartphone unit volume to be ﬂattish
to slightly up year-over-year driven by improvements in China following the
reopening of its economy .
Micron continues to build on a strong product momentum in mobile. As of ﬁscal Q1,
1-alpha comprised nearly 90% of mobile DRAM base and 176-layer made up nearly
all of our mobile NAND bit shipments. W e are also well positioned for the LP5
transition and in FQ1, the majority of our mobile DRAM bit shipments were LP5.
In ﬁscal Q1, our LP5X was validated for Qualcomm's latest platform and integrated
into Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 reference designs. In addition, we shipped the industry's
ﬁrst 1-beta DRAM qualiﬁcation samples with our 16-gigabit LP5. Last, I'll cover the
auto and industrial end markets.
Micron is well positioned as a leader in automotive and industrial markets, which
offer strong long-term growth and relatively stable margins. In ﬁscal Q1, auto
revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year , just slightly below our quarterly
record in ﬁscal Q4 2022. The automotive industry is showing early signs of supply
chain improvement and auto unit production continues to increase.
The macro environment does create some uncertainty for the auto market but we
see robust growth in auto memory demand in ﬁscal 2023. This is driven by the
volume ramp of advanced next-generation in-vehicle infotainment systems as well as
the broader adoption of more advanced driver assistance systems.
Over the next ﬁve years, we expect the bit growth CAGR for DRAM and NAND in
autos to be at approximately twice the rate of the overall DRAM and NAND markets.
The industrial market saw continued softening in Q1 as our distribution channel
partners reduced their inventory levels and end demand weakens for some
customers.
The fundamentals of industrial IoT , AI, ML, 5G and Industry 4.0, all remain intact, and
we expect volumes to improve in the second half of our ﬁscal year . In our ﬁscal ﬁrst
quarter , Micron continued to collaborate closely with customers and achieved
advanced product sampling and design-in across automation, OEMs, ODMs and
integrators with our latest generation of D5, LP5 and 3D NAND solutions.
Now turning to our market outlook. W e expect calendar 2022 industry bit demand
growth in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range for both DRAM and NAND.
For calendar 2023, we expect industry demand growth of approximately 10% in
DRAM and around 20% in NAND.
For both years, demand in DRAM and NAND is well below historical trends and
future expectations of growth largely due to reductions in end demand in most
markets, high inventories at customers, the impact of the macroeconomic
environment and the regional factors in Europe and China.
Near term, over the next few months, we expect gradually improving demand trends
for memory as customer inventory levels improve further , new CPU platforms are
launched and China demand starts to grow as the economy reopens. Longer term,
we [Audio Gap] have declined from our expectation earlier this year primarily due to
lowered growth expectations from PC and smartphone markets and some
moderation in the strong long-term growth in the cloud.
Turning to industry supply growth. Industry supply growth in calendar 2022 for DRAM
and NAND is closer to their respective long-term demand CAGRs and well above the
industry demand growth in calendar 2022. Given the current pricing and resulting
industry margins, we expect a signiﬁcant decline in industry capital investments as
well as a reduction in utilization rates for the industry . We expect that DRAM and
NAND industry supply growth in calendar year 2023 will be well below their long-term
CAGR and also well below expected demand growth in 2023.
Due to the signiﬁcant supply/demand mismatch entering calendar 2023, we expect
that proﬁtability will remain challenged throughout 2023. The timing of the recovery in
proﬁtability will be driven by the rate and pace at which supply and demand are
brought into balance and inventories are normalized across the supply chain. W e
believe that negative year-on-year calendar 2023 industry DRAM bit supply growth
and ﬂattish year-on-year calendar 2023, industry NAND bit supply growth would
accelerate this recovery .
Micron is taking a number of decisive actions in this environment to align supply with
demand and to protect our balance sheet. First, we are reducing our CapEx
investments to reduce bit supply growth in 2023 and 2024. Our ﬁscal 2023 CapEx is
being lowered to a range between $7 billion to $7.5 billion from the earlier $8 billion
target and the $12 billion level in ﬁscal year '22.
This represents approximately a 40% reduction year-on-year and we expect ﬁscal
2023 WFE to be down more than 50% year-on-year . We are now signiﬁcantly
reducing our ﬁscal 2024 CapEx from earlier plans to align with the supply-demand
environment. W e expect ﬁscal 2024 WFE to fall from ﬁscal 2023 levels even as
construction spending increases year-on-year .
Second, we have reduced near-term bit supply through a sharp reduction in wafer
starts. As we have previously announced, we reduced wafer starts for DRAM and
NAND by approximately 20%. Through a combination of these actions, we expect
our calendar 2023 production bit growth to be negative in DRAM and up only slightly
in NAND.
Given the manufacturing cycle times, the full impact of the wafer start reductions on
supply will be realized starting in our ﬁscal Q3. Due to our reductions to our ﬁscal
2024 WFE CapEx, our bit supply levels in 2024 will be materially reduced from the
prior trajectory . We continue to target a relatively ﬂat share of industry bit supply .
Third, in response to the decline in expected long-term CAGR for DRAM and NAND
bit growth, we are slowing the cadence of our process technology node transitions.
This change will help us align our long-term bit supply CAGR investments. Given our
decision to slow the 1-beta DRAM production ramp, we expect that our 1-gamma
introduction will now be in 2025.
Similarly , our next NAND node beyond 232-layer will be delayed to align to the new
demand outlook and required supply growth. W e expect these changes to the
technology node cadence to be an industry-wide phenomenon. With our industry-
leading technology capability , we expect to remain very well positioned.
Fourth, we are taking signiﬁcant steps to reduce our costs and operating expenses.
We project our spending to decrease through the year driven by reductions in
external spending, productivity programs across the business, suspension of 2023
bonus company-wide, select product program reductions and lower discretionary
spend.
Executive salaries are also being cut for the remainder of ﬁscal 2023, and over the
course of calendar 2023, we are reducing our headcount by approximately 10%
through a combination of voluntary attrition and personnel reductions.
We expect to exit ﬁscal 2023 with quarterly OpEx of around $850 million with
additional savings and cost in our P&L. Although we have taken these aggressive
steps, we are prepared to make further changes and remain ﬂexible to exercise all
levers to control our supply and manage our cost structure.
I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay . Fiscal Q1 revenue and EPS came within our guidance ranges
despite worsening market conditions over the course of the quarter . Total ﬁscal Q1
revenue was approximately $4.1 billion, down 39% sequentially and down 47% year-
over-year .
Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total revenue. DRAM
revenue declined 41% sequentially with bit shipments decreasing in the mid-20%
range and prices declining in the low 20% range.
Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $1.1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total
revenue. NAND revenue declined 35% sequentially with bit shipments declining in
the mid-teens percent range and prices declining in the low 20 percentage range.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and networking business unit
revenue was $1.7 billion, with weakness across client, data center , graphics and
networking. Embedded business unit revenue was $1 billion, with automotive staying
stronger than consumer and industrial markets. Storage business unit revenue was
$680 million, while QLC mix increased to a new high.
Mobile business unit revenue was $655 million, a low level, partly due to the timing of
shipments between ﬁscal Q1 and ﬁscal Q2. W e expect mobile revenue to grow
through the rest of the ﬁscal year . The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q1 was
22.9%, down approximately 17 percentage points sequentially , primarily due to lower
pricing.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q1 were down roughly $50 million sequentially to $101
billion. W e are taking signiﬁcant additional actions to reduce our operating expenses
through the remainder of this ﬁscal year . We reported an operating loss of $65 million
in ﬁscal Q1, resulting in an operating margin of negative 2%, down from operating
margins of 25% in the prior quarter and 35% in the prior year .
Fiscal Q1 adjusted EBITDA  was $1.8 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of 45%,
down 9 percentage points sequentially . Fiscal Q1 taxes were $1 million as a result of
proﬁt before tax being close to breakeven. Non-GAAP  loss per share in ﬁscal Q1
was $0.04, down from earnings per share of $1.45 in ﬁscal Q4 2022 and $2.16 in the
year ago quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. W e generated $943 million in cash from
operations in ﬁscal Q1, representing approximately 23% of revenue. Capital
expenditures were $2.5 billion during the quarter , and we see CapEx trending down
from these levels through ﬁscal '23.
Free cash ﬂow was negative $1.5 billion in the quarter . Under a 10b5-1 plan in place
during the quarter , we completed share repurchases of $425 million or 8.6 million
shares at an average price of $49.57. Our ending ﬁscal Q1 inventory was $8.4
billion, and average DIO for the quarter was 214 days.
The rapid decline in bit shipments in ﬁscal Q4 and ﬁscal Q1 has driven inventories
well above our target levels, and our actions reﬂect our intent to work these down.
We expect our DIO to peak in our ﬁscal Q2 and then gradually improve.
We ended the quarter with $12.1 billion of total cash and investments and $14.6
billion of total liquidity . Given macroeconomic uncertainty and the market
environment, we bolstered our liquidity in the quarter through $3.4 billion of added
debt, bringing our total ﬁscal Q1 ending debt to $10.3 billion.
With this additional debt and net of income on our deposits, we project net interest
income of approximately $15 million in the ﬁscal second quarter . We project and
intend to maintain ample liquidity while maintaining leverage consistent with our
investment-grade rating.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal second quarter . The near-term market
environment remains challenging and negatively impacts our proﬁtability outlook. For
both DRAM and NAND, we expect bit shipments to be up in ﬁscal Q2, but revenue to
be down.
Included in the ﬁscal second quarter guide is an insurance recovery of approximately
$120 million, most of which will be recognized as revenue. This insurance recovery is
related to an operational disruption in 2017 and settlement occurred in ﬁscal Q2.
Beyond ﬁscal Q2, we expect revenue and free cash ﬂow to improve in our ﬁscal
second half as we anticipate a continued recovery in demand. Related to announced
wafer start reductions, we forecast approximately $460 million of headwinds to our
cost of goods sold in ﬁscal '23, most of which we expect to incur in the second half.
Excluding these underutilization ef fects, we expect ﬁscal 2023 cost per bit reduction
to be healthy in DRAM but to be challenged in NAND, primarily due to inﬂation and
energy costs unique to Singapore.
As higher cost inventory sell-through, we expect these underutilization impacts to
continue into ﬁscal 2024. In this environment and considering the outlook, we
continue to aggressively manage costs. And as Sanjay mentioned, we see OpEx
trending down from approximately $1 billion in ﬁscal Q1 to around $850 million by
ﬁscal Q4.
Below the operating line, we will have lower net interest income, as previously
mentioned. While there is still a ﬁxed level of tax, as we discussed last quarter , due
to the geographic mix and level of income, we now see ﬁscal 2023 taxes coming in
at less than $250 million. W e are reducing our planned capital expenditures in ﬁscal
2023 to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion with the spending weighted
towards the ﬁrst half of the ﬁscal year .
Fiscal 2023 CapEx includes an increased level of construction for long-term capacity
planning. WFE CapEx will be down more than 50% year-over-year . We are also
signiﬁcantly reducing CapEx in ﬁscal 2024 compared to prior plans. Until market
conditions and our cash ﬂows improve, we will focus our capital return on dividends
and have suspended our share repurchases for now .
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q2 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $3.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in
the range of 8.5%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $945 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax expense of
approximately $60 million.
Based on a share count of approximately 1.09 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a
loss of $0.62, plus or minus $0.10. As we work through this period of challenging
market conditions, Micron has the beneﬁt of best-in-class technology , a competitive
product portfolio, strong operations, a solid balance sheet and most critically , a
tenacious team.
Beyond this downturn and over the long term, we are conﬁdent that memory and
storage revenue growth will outpace the broader semiconductor industry . This is
supported by the combination of strong secular trends, memory content growth and
better supply-demand balance. Micron is focused on operating and investing in a
responsible and disciplined manner to achieve proﬁtable growth and free cash ﬂow
generation consistent with our long-term model.
I will now turn it back to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. In the last several months, we have seen a dramatic drop in
demand. Micron has responded quickly to reduce our CapEx and supply output, and
we are taking strong enterprise-wide actions to control our expenses.
We have increased liquidity on our balance sheet and adjusted our operational
plans. While the environment remains challenging, we currently expect second half
ﬁscal 2023 revenue to improve from the ﬁrst half.
We are conﬁdent that the broad advantages enabled by data-centric technologies
will create long-term growth for our industry and expect the total available market to
reach approximately $300 billion by 2030.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our ﬁrst question will come from the line of Tim Arcuri with
UBS. Please go ahead.
Tim Arcuri
Sanjay , I had a question about the market outlook for DRAM. You have already said
that your DRAM production will be down mid- to high singles year-over-year in
calendar '23. And then you said in your remarks, you said that if the industry
production was down, this would accelerate the recovery in proﬁtability . But at this
point, I guess, I have two questions.
One, do you think the industry will be down in terms of production for DRAM?
There's some concern about what your big core income competitor is going to do. So
I'm just sort of curious, do you think that they are cutting such that the industry
production in DRAM will be down just like yours is down year-over-year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So Tim, I would like to point out that what we said is that our DRAM supply growth
would be slightly negative in ﬁscal year '23. So not mid- to single high single digits --
supply growth for Micron would be negative. That's because we have taken the
actions. W e are taking the actions in terms of supply -- wafer output reduction
reducing supply through underutilization in the fab. And as you know , we have also
CapEx reduction. W e have pushed out our 1-beta DRAM production in the fab so
that we can bring our supply closer to demand.
So the industry is oversupplied, and we do believe that actions need to be taken as
reﬂected in Micron's actions with respect to supply reduction. And of course, the rate
and pace of the industry supply cuts would af fect the recovery of the industry in
terms of bringing supply and demand balance closer together . So look, I mean, we
cannot speciﬁcally comment with respect to the -- our competitors. But what we can
tell you is that if the industry supply is -- supply growth in calendar year '23 is
negative, and for DRAM and ﬂattish for NAND, it will accelerate the recovery in the
industry .
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question and that will come from the line of C.J.
Muse with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
C.J. Muse
I guess the question is your -- you've -- in the last few years, really taking the
leadership role both in DRAM and NAND. And so as you think about hitting the worst
downturn in 13 years and taking the appropriate reductions in supply and cost. How
can you, at the same time, make sure that you maintain your leadership? What are
you doing on that front? Such that when we do go into the next upturn that you are in
that lead position, lead role and can really take advantage of technology again.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, C.J. Of course, Micron is in a strong technology position. W e feel very
good about our technology capabilities and our road map. Our -- if you look at our 1-
alpha DRAM that compared to our prior 1-z node gave us a 40% bit efﬁciency gain
per wafer . And now if you look at our 1-beta, industry , you would expect less, but
what you see in our 1-beta node is a 35% improvement in terms of bit efﬁciency per
wafer versus our 1-alpha node.
And our 1-beta DRAM node is well designed for D5, DDR5 deployment as well with
good performance and good power efﬁciency improvements over prior products. So
it's really 1-beta is a very good node when you compare it to any other even EUV
nodes that are out there in the industry . So it's an industry-leading node. W e are well
positioned with our 1-beta node.
And of course, our 1-gamma node will be well positioned as well. And we are timing
the production of these nodes to maximize the ROI in our R&D and manufacturing.
And of course, to bring supply and demand in balance overall and keeping in mind
the longer-term CAGR for DRAM growth and adjusting our technology cadence
accordingly .
So I think we are managing our technology node development and manufacturing
plans our supply plans in a highly responsible fashion, and we'll be well positioned
with our technology . And same thing on NAND side, our 232-NAND is in very good
shape. Both 1-beta and 232-layer NAND in terms of cost, in terms of quality and in
terms of, of course yields, we are well positioned with them and continuing to work
with customers in qualifying those products.
So not only just 1-beta and 232 layer , we feel good about our technology road map,
capabilities and position with our plans for 1-gamma and the node beyond the 232-
layer in NAND. And just to point out that Micron, I was recently talking to a leading
customer and executive there, and the customer was facing Micron's as being the
best in the industry .
And same kind of accolades we get from customers on LP5, on GDDR6 on our QLC
NAND. And of course, we are broadening our portfolio of products too. So not only
with respect to technology , we are well positioned. I think we are well positioned with
respect to our product momentum as well.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Chris
Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Chris Caso
Question is on the pace of gross margins as you go through the year . And you spoke
about revenue and free cash ﬂow being better in the second half. Do you believe
that's the case for gross margins as well? Do you think gross margins are bottoming
here? And if you can comment about some of the impact of the unutilization charges
and how they ﬂow through the year and beyond Q2?
Mark Murphy
Chris, this is Mark. I'll take that. A few comments on the proﬁle. W e did say that Q1
would be the bottom for bits, and we expect bits to be up in the second quarter and
revenue down. So that points to continued challenges around the market conditions.
We also expect 2Q to be peak on DIO, but 3Q will be the peak on inventory dollars.
So the industry remains in an oversupply situation. But customers are depleting
inventories, and we expect them to be in a better position by the second quarter of
the calendar year . But proﬁt is going to be challenged through the year , and that will
challenge gross margins.
Now the utilization ef fects speciﬁcally maybe I'll talk just costs generally ﬁrst. In FY
'22, and historically , Micron has strived and achieved cost downs in line or better
than the industry , node advancements, manufacturing, productivity and other factors.
But ﬁscal year '23 is going to be challenging in the near term as these utilization
effects and low volumes weigh on the cost per unit and weigh on margins. And there
are three principal drivers that will help explain that. One is maybe an overlooked
factor is just simply the ef fects of routine period costs that run through the business
on a normal basis, scrap preproduction volumes, pre-qual volumes, freight, royalties,
these sort of things.
And when you add this sharp decline in volumes and revenue, those period cost
effects are going to impact margins. And so we're seeing that. The second driver is
the much lower volumes are creating underload issues in the back end. And of
course, that creates higher cost inventories that some is period cost, but most of it
still hangs up in inventory and creates higher inventory costs.
And that also is a signiﬁcant factor early in the year , especially weighing on our
costs. And then third, most visible has been our announcements to lower utilization
on the front end. And that is a signiﬁcant cost -- and we have -- most of those costs
are going to be in inventories also versus period cost. And we said that $460 million
of -- which is over -- just over half of the total ﬁxed costs that will need to be applied
will impact FY  '23.
Now the rest of those costs will ﬂow through in FY  '24. Now if our volumes are better
than expected, those higher cost inventories will be pulled through earlier , if volumes
are less than expected than more of those costs will ﬂow through in FY  '24. But right
now, we're seeing about $460 million in FY  '23.
So in summary , we expect cost per bit to be up modestly in Q1. Again, that's mostly
just the period cost ef fects that are normal and then some back-end ef fects and
that's related to just low volumes. That's going to be a bit more cost in the second
quarter . Again, and this is more back-end ef fects as those inventories clear . And then
the third quarter , we're going to have the back-end ef fects of underutilization and the
front-end ef fects as that inventory starts to clear .
But then in the third quarter and then especially in the fourth, we have of fsets. In fact,
we get -- we resume cost down in the fourth quarter , as volumes have been -- as
volumes pick up and absorption occurs. It's not a permanent condition. This is just a
function of volumes that are unseen drops in volumes, and you see -- and actually
the steps that we're actively taking to reduce supply .
And I think it's worth noting that cost is certainly important. It's a great focus. W e're
managing the details. But the largest impact to the proﬁtability and ﬁnancial outlook
for us is the supply-demand balance -- and the rate and pace of this improvement is
going to be a function of aligning supply with demand, and we're taking decisive
actions on CapEx and utilization to address it.

Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Tom
O'Malley with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tom O'Malley
My question is really on the demand side. I think that you did a good job of calling out
what you saw from an end market perspective into next year . But I just wanted to ask
speciﬁcally on the data center . You've called out inventory in the past, but versus
where you guys talked about the data center last quarter , do you think that inventory
at customers was worse than you initially thought? Or do you think that you're seeing
a weakening in terms of data center and demand?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So inventories with data center customers including cloud is higher than what we
thought. So that inventory adjustment has begun, and it has some wood to chop in
that area. And of course, the end demand for cloud operations that are driven by
consumer-related activities given the overall consumer environment and the macro
trends, some portions of cloud and demand may be weaker as a result of that as
well. And also in the macro environment that exists today , there is -- given the higher
interest rates and other macro trends, companies do become somewhat cautious in
terms of managing their overall expenses and any long-term agreements, et cetera.
So that can impact some of the current environment for end demand in cloud. But
what I would like to point out is that digitization trends ultimately do remain positive.
Cloud deﬁnitely helps drive that efﬁciency that businesses seek in an environment
like this. W e do absolutely expect that once we get past the current macroeconomic
environment and macroeconomic weakening, longer-term trends for cloud will
remain strong. In terms of the current environment, yes, inventory adjustments and
some impact of cloud and demand weakening as well. that's impacting our overall
data center outlook.

Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Krish
Sankar with Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar
I just have a quick question for Mark. Mark, you said inventory base to peak in the
second quarter and inventory dollars in F3Q. What kind of inventory days should we
expect in F3Q? And what is the risk of inventory write-down? Kind of wondering what
is your inventory write-down methodology?
Mark Murphy
Sure. I think I got the question. So the -- as mentioned, the DIO peak, we expect to
be in 2Q, the dollars in 3Q. And from both those peaks, we expect it to gradually
improve, which is consistent with proﬁles that we've said before, though the
conditions have worsened and volumes are a bit lower .
Yes, we do expect customers to be in better shape by the second quarter of calendar
year, and that's encouraging. And then you've seen the steps we've taken on supply
to get inventories down. But I did cover this recently at a conference, bears
repeating.
Inventory is -- it's obviously a risk where we carefully and thoroughly monitor and
with the lower utilization we have and the higher costs associated with that per unit.
And then the weak market conditions we have, the margin of safety we have has
decreased from where it was. W e did a thorough quarter-end analysis as we always
do.
And of course, that includes the outlook. And in that, we determined that there are no
write-downs to the lower of cost or net realizable value warranted. W e perform
extensive reviews of project -- projected pricing. W e analyze customer trends, and
there are a number of other factors.
If our estimates did change, further , there could be risk of write-of f in future quarters
but none this in the November quarter . I do refer you to our inventory policy that's
disclosed in our 10-K. W e have a long-standing policy of evaluating inventory as a
single pool, and we evaluate this policy regularly , and we apply consistently .
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Mehdi
Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes. Sanjay , I want to go back to your , the color you provided on the demand trend
by end customer or by end application. You've highlighted that the PC unit are
expected to be down 5% to 10%. If I just take the current build rate in December and
apply a seasonal decline in Q1, it suggests to me that PCs as the end market
application would bottom by March, April time frame, let's say , post-Chinese New
Year. Could that be a catalyzed -- could that actually catalyze a more improved
visibility with pricing for DRAM and NAND? And I asked you because it was the PC
end market that rolled over . And I'm just trying to better understand whether PCM
market could help stabilize certain part of the DRAM and NAND segments?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, of course, the markets where DRAM and NAND are well diversiﬁed. PC is one
of the markets. And we already talked about the decline in PC units. Actually , in
calendar year '22, high teens decline in PC units. This is the sharpest decline in the
history of the PCs, and smartphones, another area where unit sales of smartphones
globally down 10% as well. And that, too, historically , in terms of a decline is high. So
these are, of course, impacting the end consumer demand and then inventory
adjustments on top of it impacting the demand.
And of course, as I spoke about earlier , that inventory adjustments are happening in
other parts of the market as well. I think with respect to our outlook for next year in
terms of demand, we expect about 10% demand growth for DRAM in calendar year
'23. And when you look at mid-single digits, low- to mid-single-digit demand growth in
'22 and approximately 10% in '23 that over a two-year time period is really
signiﬁcantly lower growth rate compared to the years in the past, the CAGRs that
have been prevalent over time.
So, I think what's important here is that the supply has to be reduced. The biggest
factor here really would be the supply reduction. Of course, once inventory
adjustments, we are able to get past and the macroeconomic environment improves.
The long-term trends for demand, driven by all the factors we have spoken about
before, AI, 5G, industrial IoT , autonomous, all of those long-term factors will drive that
demand along the lines of the CAGR that we have discussed today .
But in the near term, the biggest factor to really address the demand supply is a
reduction in supply in the industry . And of course, the rate and pace of the ﬁnancial
performance improvement will very much depend on how fast supply comes into
balance.
And as we have discussed, we have taken our actions in terms of CapEx reduction,
in terms of underutilization, in terms of adjusting the technology node cadence. And
we do believe that with the supply actions, the industry environment will improve. I do
see that in ﬁscal year '24, the revenue, the proﬁt and the free cash ﬂow proﬁle would
be much better than '23. And of course, again, will be a function of how quickly the
supplier just to demand.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question, that will come from the line of Toshiya
Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari
I had one quick clariﬁcation and then a question, clariﬁcation for Mark. You talked
about the $460 million of headwind related to the underutilization of your fabs. When
you throw out that estimate, what assumptions are you making for utilization rates for
the next couple of quarters? You obviously talked about the 20% cut as of today .
But are you assuming you stay at that 20% rate for Feb, May and perhaps August?
Or are you assuming production rates or utilization rates kind of step up as you
progress through the remainder of the ﬁscal year . And then the question is on the
demand side. Sanjay , in your prepared remarks, you talked about customer inventory
normalization and new server CPU platforms in China reopening as some of the key
drivers for bit growth over the next couple of months or few months.
How much visibility do you have into those three dynamics? You talked a little bit
about inventory , but we're hearing customer inventory in some cases, might be
increasing given some of the deals, not just you speciﬁcally , but the industry is
striking, the server platforms could be a little bit more skewed to the second half of
calendar '23 and China reopening still seems pretty gray . So curious what kind of
visibility you have there.
Mark Murphy
Yes, Toshi, I'll just brieﬂy touch on the ﬁrst one. W e're expecting these elevated
underutilization levels through most of -- well, through ﬁscal year '23. And beyond
that, we're just going to always be evaluating the market conditions and then we'll
update you and the market accordingly .
Sanjay Mehrotra
And on your questions regarding customer inventory , what I would like to point out is
that customer inventory in aggregate -- and that means in terms of volume in bits, we
believe it has come down, although still at high levels. And you can see that in Q2,
we are guiding to increase bit shipments. And just keep in mind that where demand
used to be in terms of or the industry shipments used to be a few quarters ago
versus now , they have come down substantially .
And even though there may be some end market weakening in demand that points
to that some of the inventory is being consumed by the customers. Basically , some of
the inventory that the customers are holding is being consumed by them to address
their end demand. So basically , the ship out by customers is greater than the ship in,
in terms of purchases by customers from suppliers. And this trend of inventory
improvement, gradual inventory improvement we believe will continue.
And by mid calendar '23, we are projecting even though we don't have perfect
visibility , but based on all of our discussions with our customers, we are projecting
that inventory at customers will be in relatively healthier position by that time. And
that's where we say that our second half of ﬁscal year revenue will be greater than
ﬁrst half, and we would expect continued improvements beyond the second half as
well.
And regarding the question on China, of course, China reopening has to be
monitored closely , and it may be choppy . In terms of the near term, we are assuming
that China is reopening for the second half of the calendar year , will result in beneﬁt
in terms of increased demand coming from the China markets.
And of course, China reopening is not just issue to be monitored in terms of Chinese
customer demand, but also any impact on global electronics system supply chains.
And of course, we have assembly and test operations in China as well, and we are
continuing to monitor those as well with respect to some of the recent COVID cases
there. So, I think China, COVID cases and reopening will have to be -- continued to
be closely monitored.
Toshiya Hari
And Sanjay , Sapphire Rapids in Genoa, the new server CPU platforms, visibility
there in terms of the ramp?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So our products are well positioned, and we expect that these will be ramping during
the course of '23 and, of course, continue to ramp in '24 as well. And these are the
ones that will drive a greater D5 attach with the servers. And as we said, we expect
that for servers, D5 in 30s percentage range in terms of deployment by end of
calendar '23 and somewhere around 50% by mid-calendar .
So our products are well positioned, and we are looking forward to deployment of
those new CPU platforms and that will drive healthier dynamic with respect to D5
deployment. These new processors, they work with more cores. They increase the
attach rate for memory because they are bandwidth hungry and that just points to
greater adoption of DRAM, particularly D5 memory with those processors.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you so much.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So of course, it has been pushed out. I mean compared to the plans last year or over
the last few months, some of those new processor deployments have been pushed
out, but we look forward to them getting broadly adopted as the year progresses in
'23.
Operator
Thank you. And we do have time for one ﬁnal question. And that will come from the
line of Aaron Rakers with W ells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers
I'll make just a quick question. I'm just curious, as you guys kind of thought about the
guidance for this current quarter and given the pace of change that we saw in the
pricing environment through the course of this last quarter . I guess, when you roll up
your assumptions for DRAM and NAND, is it as simple to think that you guys are
assuming kind of a similar pricing environment our pace of pricing declined this
quarter as we saw last quarter? Or are you kind of factoring in any kind of
acceleration of price degradation?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So look, we don't comment speciﬁcally on pricing, but I can certainly tell you that
both DRAM and NAND are experiencing challenging environment. And again, it is
about oversupply in the market and decisive actions that we have highlighted today
are the kind of actions that are important to make progress towards bringing supply
and demand into balance.
