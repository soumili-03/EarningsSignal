Highlights   
Micron delivered strong revenue and earnings in FQ1. I am proud of the Micron team for continuing our 
business momentum and putting Micron in a better technology and product position than ever before, 
despite the ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic. We began shipping the industry’s most advanced 
NAND with 176 layers. And in DRAM, we made good progress on our 1 -alpha node and are on track to 
begin volume production in the first half of calendar 2021. We believe DRAM is past the b ottom of the 
industry cycle and expect improving trends through calendar 2021 as the digitization of the global economy 
continues, fueled by artificial intelligence, cloud, 5G, and the intelligent edge, including smart vehicles.  
Against this backdrop, M icron is poised to emerge stronger, and we are excited about our future .

 Operations  
I will start with a quick update on our manufacturing operations. In early December, two separate events 
affected our Taiwan DRAM operations. The first event was a power ou tage at our Taoyuan facility, which 
occurred on December 3rd, the last day of our fiscal first quarter. The second event, a 6.7 -magnitude 
earthquake off the northeast coast of Taiwan, occurred on December 10th. The earthquake was felt at both 
our Taoyuan a nd Taichung locations. The investments we have made over the last few years in facilities’ 
redundancy and cleanroom control substantially mitigated the impact of these two events. However, these 
disruptions have reduced our available FQ2 DRAM supply and negatively influenced our costs in the short -
term. The expected impact of these events is factored into our outlook .  
Tech Roadmap  
Micron continues to make solid progress on our key goals:  
First, to deliver industry -leading technology a nd improve our cost structure. Second, to bring differentiated 
products to market and improve our product mix. And third, to grow our share of industry profits while 
maintaining stable bit share.  
From FY16 to FY20, we substantially improved our EBITDA mar gin for our combined DRAM and NAND 
business while the rest of the industry in aggregate was roughly flat.  And over the last few years, we have 
accelerated our technology roadmap in both DRAM and NAND.  As a result, for the first time in our history, 
Micro n has technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND simultaneously. Now that we are leading the 
industry in technology capability, going forward, we expect to maintain this competitive position through a 
more typical cadence for node transitions consistent w ith the rest of the industry.  
In DRAM, we are making good progress on our 1 -alpha node. This will be an outstanding technology node 
for Micron, delivering a 40% improvement in bits per wafer over our 1z. A substantial portion of this 
improvement comes from  our chip -design concepts that provide greater memory array efficiency. Following 
the extraordinary improvements of our 1 -alpha node, we anticipate lower gains in bits -per-wafer growth as 
more complex interfaces such as DDR5 are introduced  and as DRAM technology scaling challenges 
continue. We are also making progress with differentiated DRAM products such as GDDR6 and 6X for 
graphics. In FQ1, we saw strong growth in bit shipments for these products. We also began re venue 
shipments of HBM2E products . 
In NAND, in early November, we began volume production of our second -generation replacement -gate 
node  (176-layer) , which is the most advanced in the industry, combining our replacement -gate architecture, 
CMOS under the array  and adv anced charge -trap process technology. It also features double the power 
efficiency and write performance of Micron’s 96 -layer 3D NAND. These improvements are essential for

 addressing future high -end mobile applications. We began shipping 176 -layer consumer  SSDs in FQ1 and 
will be introducing products built with this technology across the rest of our product portfolio over the next 
several months. We are also driving product innovations and cost reductions through an increased mix of 
QLC NAND, and we are leading the industry with the broadest portfolio of QLC SSDs across client, consumer 
and data center markets. QLC helps to make SSDs more cost -effective and accelerates the replacement of 
HDDs with SSDs. QLC SSD adoption continues to grow, and our bit mix of QLC SSDs increased further in 
FQ1. 
Turning to end markets:  
End Market Highlights  
Data Center  
In data center, cloud and AI will drive long -term growth, with memory and storage becoming an increasing 
portion of server BO M cost. New compute architectures are enabling more memory channels and higher -
density modules, contributing to increases in server memory content. Micron is positioned for success in 
this market, with a broad portfolio of high -bandwidth, high -quality and power -efficient products. Cloud 
and enterprise DRAM revenue declined sequentially from a very strong 14 -week FQ4, with ongoing 
enterprise market weakness. In FQ1, we began revenue shipments for our ultra -bandwidth HBM2E memory, 
which is used for data cente r AI training and inference. We are making progress on the DDR5 transition, 
which will double bandwidth and reduce power consumption, and we plan to start that transition in the 
second half of fiscal 2021 . 
In data center SSDs, we continue to make progress on our NVMe portfolio and completed several customer 
qualifications in FQ1. We also continue to maintain our leadership position in SATA. Data center SSD 
revenue declined sequentially but was up year -over-year as cloud growth offset a decline in enterprise . We 
remain focused on strengthening our data center NVMe SSD roadmap with internally developed controllers 
and have new product introductions planned in the coming quarters.  
Mobile  
Our FQ1 mobile revenue was up sequentially, driven by solid execution and improved handset demand. A 
better -than-expected transition of Micron’s mobile business from Huawei to other mobile customers also 
contributed to our revenue upside in FQ1. Micron is well positioned to win in the 5G era with our industry -
leading product por tfolio. We had several key achievements in our mobile business in FQ1. We maintained 
LP5 solutions leadership and grew our LP5 shipments, were the first to market with uMCP5  and achieved 
record MCP revenue.

 PC 
In PC, the continued remote work and learning trend drove strong notebook and Chromebook demand in 
the quarter, despite pockets of nonmemory  component shortages in the supply chain. We delivered strong 
sequential growth in PC DRAM shipments driven by this demand. In client SSD, NVMe represen ted over 
90% of the client SSD bits, with nearly half of those NVMe SSD bits being QLC. Consumer SSDs had a second 
consecutive record quarter for bit shipments, and we shipped the world’s first 176 -layer -based consumer 
SSDs.  
Graphics  
In graphics, we achiev ed strong GDDR6 and 6X bit shipment growth driven by new game console and PC 
graphics product launches. Micron has a strong position in this high -growth market, with a broad product 
portfolio and deep customer partnerships.  
Auto  
We had a record auto revenue quarter, resulting from the resumption of auto manufacturing around the 
globe and the continued growth of memory and storage content per vehicle. We also achieved qualification 
of our 1z LP4 DRAM and began sampling our 96 -layer -based UFS NAND. Electric vehicles have higher 
semiconductor content, and as EVs continue to proliferate, we expect our auto business to continue to 
excel. In addition, as autonomous driving features advance, this content growth trend will accelerate further. 
Micron’ s quality and market share leadership uniquely position  us to not just benefit from this growth, but 
also to drive innovative solutions for next -generation vehicles in collaboration with our ecosystem of 
customers and industry partners.  
Industry Outlook  
Now turning to our view of calendar 2020 industry demand.  
During FQ1, overall demand was strong across most end markets despite shortages of nonmemory 
components in PC, mobile, auto and graphics. Cloud demand was healthy while enterprise demand was 
weak du e to the economic environment. As a result of the stronger -than-expected demand at the end of 
the year, we now estimate that calendar 2020 industry DRAM bit demand growth was slightly above 20%, 
while NAND bit demand growth was in the mid -20s. 
Now for our calendar 2021 outlook:  
In DRAM, we are past the bottom , and the industry is in tight supply across major market segments. As a 
result, we are already seeing our calendar Q1 pricing starting to increase in several parts of the market.

 16Gb adoption in clien t and data center modules has increased, causing the same supply tightness that was 
previously seen in 8Gb, to also now be visible in 16Gb. We expect calendar 2021 DRAM industry bit demand 
growth of high teens, with DRAM industry supply to be below demand.  Stronger -than-expected industry 
demand has reduced supplier DRAM inventories. Low inventories, combined with disciplined industry CapEx 
in 2020 and a vaccine -driven recovery from the pandemic, should result in further tightening of the DRAM 
market throu gh calendar 2021. In addition, we will also benefit from higher content in 5G phones, which 
are forecast to double in unit sales in 2021 to around 500 million units. We anticipate healthy unit growth 
in the PC market, and graphics should continue to benefi t from new gaming consoles and from new gaming 
cards launched in the second half of last year. We expect the cloud market to grow at a healthy pace, and 
enterprise market recovery will be driven by the timing of the broader economic recovery.  
Calendar 2021  industry NAND bit demand growth is expected to be approximately 30%, with supply 
potentially higher. The NAND market is challenging in the near term. However, we believe that as the year 
progresses, elasticity coupled with pandemic recovery should lead to  improving demand.  We believe the 
market can stabilize over the course of  2021  if suppliers moderate their production growth.  
Long -term, we expect DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid to high teens and a NAND bit demand 
growth CAGR of approximately 30%.  
Micron Outlook  
Turning to Micron supply, we target our long -term bit supply growth CAGR to be in line with industry bit 
demand growth CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. However, there can be year -to-year variability caused by 
node -transition timing. In both DRAM  and NAND, we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply growth to be 
below the industry demand growth, and we plan to use inventory to support bit shipment growth that is in 
line with industry demand growth . 
For fiscal 2021, we expect DRAM cost reductions in the  mid-single -digit percentage range, with somewhat 
higher levels of cost reductions on a like -for-like basis. We anticipate NAND cost reductions in the low - to-
mid-teens percentage range. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support 
our long -term goal of maintaining a stable share of industry bit supply. If demand expectations change, we 
remain flexible to adjust our CapEx . 
As we look ahead, we are excited about the growth and health of our diverse end markets, which continue 
to benefit from powerful secular technology trends, including AI, cloud, 5G and the intelligent edge. These 
trends are already enabling the data economy and increasing the importance of DRAM and NAND. Memory 
and storage industry revenues have grown faster than the broader semiconductor industry, from 
approximately 10% of semiconductor industry revenues in the early 2000s to now approaching 30%. We 
expect that our TAM growth will continue to outpace the rest of the semiconductor industry over the next

 decade . Micron’s focus on technology and product leadership, operational excellence, and deep customer 
partnerships positions us well to grow our relevance and profit share in the industry . 
I’ll now turn it over to Dave to provide our financial results and guida nce. 
 
DAVE ZINSNER , SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER   
Thanks Sanjay.  
OPENING  
Micron delivered very strong fiscal first quarter results, with revenues and earnings coming in well above 
the guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. We saw an improving business environment through 
the quarter, and demand and pricing were better than expected for both DRAM and NAND.  
 
REVENUE  
Total FQ1 revenue was approximately $5.8 billion, down 5% quarter -over-quarter but up 12% year-over-
year. Adjusting for the extra week in the prior quarter, revenue increased 3% sequentially driven by strength 
in a broad set of markets, including auto, graphics, client, mobile and consumer.   
 
PERFORMANCE BY TECHNOLOGY  
DRAM  
FQ1 DRAM revenue was $4.1 billion, representing 70% of total revenue. DRAM revenue decreased 7% 
sequentially but was up 17% year -over year. Bit shipments were down in the low -single -digit percentage 
range sequentially, and ASPs were down in the mid -single -digit pe rcentage range quarter -over-quarter . 
NAND  
FQ1 NAND revenue was approximately $1.6 billion, representing 27% of total revenue. NAND revenue 
increased 3% sequentially and was up 11% year -over-year. Bit shipments increased in the high -teens 
percentage range sequentially, while ASPs declined in the low -teens percentage range quarter -over-
quarter. Half of the decline was attributable to a change in mix, which included a greater portion of 
components .

 REVENUE BY BUSINESS UNIT  
Now turning to ou r revenue trends by business unit.  
Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2.5 billion, down 
approximately 16% sequentially but up 29% year -over-year. We had solid sequential growth in graphics 
and client revenues , while data center revenues declined sequentially, coming off a particularly strong 
quarter for cloud, the loss of the extra week and continued weakness in enterprise  
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.5 billion, up 3% sequentially and up 3% year -over-year. Mobile 
demand remains strong as 5G momentum increases and the mobile market recovers from the impact of 
the pandemic.  
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $911 million, roughly flat from the prior quarter and down 6% 
year over year. As a reminder, 3D XPoint revenues are now reported in the Compute and Networking 
Business Unit. Excluding 3D XPoint from the prior year’s quarter, SBU revenues would be up 14% year -over-
year.  
Finally, revenue for the Embedded Business Unit was $809 million, u p 24% sequentially and up 10% year 
over year. EBU revenue was the highest since Q1 FY19, driven by record auto revenue as demand recovered 
from pandemic -related shutdowns . 
 
OPERATING RESULTS  
GROSS MARGIN  
The consolidated gross margin for FQ1 was 30.9%, down 400 basis points from the prior quarter. Our gross 
margin was impacted by pricing declines and a greater mix of NAND.  
OPEX  
Operating expenses were $811 million in FQ1 as we continued to tightly manage expenses.    
We are expecting to increase o perating expenses in the second half of this fiscal year as the previously 
delayed FY21 salary increases take effect at the beginning of FQ3 and we incur additional prequalification -
related expenses in FQ3 and FQ4.  As a result, we anticipate that FQ3 expe nses will increase approximately 
10% sequentially from FQ2, but of course we remain flexible to reduce operating expenses from those levels 
should business conditions warrant .

 OPERATING INCOME  
FQ1 operating income was $973 million, resulting in an operatin g margin of 17%, compared to 21% in the 
prior quarter and 12% in the prior year’s quarter.  
NET INTEREST EXPENSE  
Net interest expense was flat quarter -over-quarter at $31 million.  
We expect the net interest expense to be approximately $35 million in FQ2. 
TAXES  
Our FQ1 effective tax rate was 7.4%. We expect our tax rate to be in the mid to high single digits for the 
remainder of FY21. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE  
Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ1 were $0.78, down from $1.08 in FQ4 and up from $0.48 in the year -
ago quarter. EPS included 2 cents of nonoperating income related to gains from investments in our venture 
arm, Micron Ventures . 
OPERATING CASH FLOW  
Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated approximately $2 billion in cash from oper ations 
in FQ1, representing 34% of revenue.  
 
CAPITAL ALLOCATION  
CapEx and Free Cash Flow  
Net capital spending was approximately $2.8 billion during the quarter. We expect approximately $9 billion 
in capital spending for FY21 with spending weighted towards the first half of the fiscal year. Free cash flow 
in the quarter was negative $816 million. We expect free cash flow to remain negative in FQ2 but to improve 
from the FQ1 level, driven by increased cash flow from operations. As we said previously, we expect to 
generate healthy free cash flow during the second half of FY21.  Although we didn’t repurchase shares in 
FQ1, we remain committed to returning greater than 50% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders 
through share repurchases

 INVENTORY  
We made a significant improvement on our days of inventory and ended FQ1 with $5.5 billion of inventory 
or 125 days versus 135 days last quarter.  
As we look ahead to FQ2, I want to share some changes to our upcoming inventory reporting. Starting in 
FQ2, w e will be using a FIFO (or first in, first out) approach to inventory valuation, as opposed to the average 
cost method that we have historically used. Concurrently, we are introducing a new costing methodology 
that uses standard costing. These changes will  help us improve our business reporting by valuing inventory 
at the most recent production costs and aligning with general semiconductor industry practices . While we 
expect no material impact to our non-GAAP results from these changes, we do expect to rec ord a one -time 
non-cash charge of approximately $300 million, which will impact our FQ2 GAAP results and reduce the 
carrying value of our inventory.  Unlike certain valuation adjustments or write -downs to inventory, this is a 
permanent methodology change th at will not result in a material impact to our future costs or margins. 
Concurrently with these changes, we will also reclassify  spare parts from inventory to other current assets, 
which also better aligns with the rest of the industry. This new representa tion will reduce our inventory 
balance and consequently, our days of inventory will decline by approximately 10 days versus the old 
methodology.  Applying this 10 -day decline, our FQ1 days of inventory would have been approximately 115 
days, and our new days of inventory target is approximately 95 to 105 days. We expect to reach our days 
of inventory target in the second half of FY21. 
TOTAL CASH/DEBT  
We end ed the quarter with total cash of $8.4 billion and total liquidity of approximately $10.9 billion. FQ1 
ending total debt was $6.6 billion.  
 
NON -GAAP GUIDANCE    
OUTLOOK  
Now turning to our outlook.  
We are seeing improving conditions across multiple DRAM end markets with strong demand in cloud, client, 
auto and mobile. This demand recovery would be even stronger if it weren’t for the shortages of 
nonmemory components in several markets. On the supply side, as Sanjay mentioned, a power outage and 
an earthquake have limited our DRAM supply, and we are rapidly drawing down on our inventory across 
DRAM and NAND.   
 
 
Micron Technology, Inc.  
Fiscal Q 1 2021 Earnings Call  Prepared Remarks

 From a gross margin perspective, the power outage and earthquake impact will be a headwind to  our DRAM 
cost reductions in FQ2. Additionally, the timing of new DRAM and NAND node ramps also limits our cost 
reductions for FQ2.  
GUIDANCE  
With all these factors in mind, our non -GAAP guidance for FQ1 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $5.8 
billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 31%, plus or minus 100 basis points; 
and operating expenses to be approximately $825 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a 
share count of approximately 1.15 billion fully dilu ted shares, we expect earnings per share to be $0.75, plus 
or minus $0.07.  
As we look beyond FQ2, we anticipate that a vaccine -driven economic recovery combined with secular 
trends such as 5G adoption and AI will result in stronger demand. In the second h alf of FY21, we expect 
improved financial performance, driven by strengthening market conditions and a stronger cost reduction 
across DRAM and NAND.  
 
CLOSING  
In closing, we’re confident in Micron’s ability to deliver strong long -term revenue growth and cross -cycle 
profitability. Over the last four years, Micron has delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins 
of 50% and return on invested capital of 20%. We believe Micron’s strong performance will continue cross -
cycle.  
As we look to the expected upturn in the DRAM business in calendar 2021, Micron’s relentless focus on 
execution positions us well to generate solid returns for our shareholders.  
I’ll now turn the call over to Sanjay for closing remarks.  
 
Sanjay Mehrotra, President and Chief Executive Officer  
Thank you, Dave.  
Over the last year, Micron delivered strong performance in the face of significant challenges from COVID.   
I am thankful to the Micron team, whose tenacity and resilience enabled us to navigate this c hallenging

 period and maintain production at normal levels while continuing to advance our technology and product 
portfolio.   
Micron is poised to emerge stronger in calendar 2021 as the world recovers from the pandemic. We are 
confident in our roadmap to further enhance our competitive position while exercising supply discipline. 
We are in a better position than ever before, and this has been recognized by our customers. Recently, 
Micron received supplier awards from multiple customers, including from tier  1 China smartphone OEMs.  
We also continue to make great strides in advancing our corporate responsibility agenda. In November, 
Micron published our FY20 annual diversity, equality and inclusion report, detailing our progress over the 
year and our commitme nts for FY21. In 2020, we increased our female board representation and also made 
investments to improve representation of all underrepresented groups, including Blacks and Latinx, in 
technical and leadership roles. We expanded our pay equity initiative be yond gender to also include other 
underrepresented groups and to consider total compensation across pay and equity awards. We’re working 
with industry organizations to establish best practices in supplier diversity and to support the inclusion and 
competit iveness of diverse suppliers in the semiconductor industry. And finally, we leveraged the power of 
Micron’s influence in the communities where we live and work to advocate for greater social justice and 
safety globally.  
We are also proud to report that, in  November, we were added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, 
joining the ranks of the most sustainable American companies. We aim to build on this recognition as we 
advance on our sustainability goals this year  
Thank y ou, and now w e will open the call for questions.
