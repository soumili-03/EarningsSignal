Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered a strong ﬁnish to
ﬁscal year 2024, with ﬁscal Q4 revenue at the high end of our guidance range and
gross margins and EPS above the high end of our guidance ranges.
In ﬁscal Q4, we achieved record-high revenues in NAND and in our storage business
unit. Micron's ﬁscal 2024 revenue grew over 60%. W e expanded company gross
margins by over 30 percentage points and achieved revenue records in data center
and in automotive. I am thankful to all our Micron team members for their focus and
execution, which made these results possible.
We are entering ﬁscal 2025 with the strongest competitive positioning in Micron's
history . We have leadership 1-beta DRAM and G8 and G9 NAND process
technology , and leadership products across our end markets. Robust data center
demand is exceeding our leading-edge node supply and is driving overall healthy
supply-demand dynamics.
As we move through calendar 2025, we expect a broadening of demand drivers,
complementing strong demand in the data center . We are making investments to
support AI-driven demand and our manufacturing network is well positioned to
execute on these opportunities.
We look forward to delivering a substantial revenue record with signiﬁcantly improved
proﬁtability in ﬁscal 2025, beginning with our guidance for record quarterly revenue in
ﬁscal Q1. Micron is ramping production of the industry's most advanced technology
nodes in both DRAM and NAND.
Our 1-beta DRAM and G8 and G9 NAND nodes are ramping in high volume and will
become an increasing portion of our mix through ﬁscal 2025. As a reminder , our G8
NAND node refers to our 232-layer NAND technology node. Our 1-gamma DRAM
pilot production using extreme ultraviolet lithography is progressing well, and we are
on track for volume production in calendar 2025.
We delivered ﬁscal 2024 DRAM front-end cost reductions at the high end of the
outlook provided at the beginning of the year and NAND cost reductions were
consistent with our forecast. W e expect ﬁscal 2025 DRAM front-end cost reductions
excluding HBM to be in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range. W e expect
ﬁscal 2025 NAND cost reductions to be in the low-to-mid teens percentage range.
We continue to make progress on the construction for our new fab in Idaho and are
working with state and federal agencies on the permitting process for our New York
site. Construction is underway on our India assembly and test facility , as well as our
China Xi'an back-end expansion.
We are continuously assessing opportunities to manage our manufacturing footprint
in a capital-efﬁcient manner . Consistent with this strategy , we announced the
acquisition of an LCD factory in Taiwan that will be converted to enable DRAM
production testing. Micron's proprietary and vertically integrated testing capabilities
provide competitive dif ferentiation and enable us to provide high-quality products to
our customers.
Now turning to our end markets. Memory is essential to extend the frontier of AI
capability . Multiple vectors will drive AI memory demand over the coming years.
Growing model sizes and input token requirements, multimodality , multiagent
solutions, continuous training, and the proliferation of inference workloads from cloud
to the edge.
Micron is focused on translating the opportunities from AI demand into value
captured for all our stakeholders. Demand from data center customers continues to
be strong and customer inventory levels are healthy . Industry server unit shipments
are expected to grow in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage range in calendar
2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers as well as low single-digit percentage
range growth for traditional servers.
We expect traditional server demand to beneﬁt from a refresh cycle as a single
latest-generation traditional server can replace multiple older-generation servers to
provide valuable space, power and performance improvements to improve data
center efﬁciency . We see increasing DRAM and NAND content both in traditional as
well as AI servers.
Our mix of data center revenue reached a record level in ﬁscal 2024 and we expect
will grow signiﬁcantly from here in ﬁscal 2025. Micron is well positioned in the data
center with our portfolio of HBM, high-capacity D5 and LP5 solutions, and data
center SSD products. W e expect each of these three product categories to deliver
multiple billions of dollars in revenue in ﬁscal 2025.
In HBM, we are making excellent progress on our yield and output capability . In ﬁscal
Q4, we delivered on our expected volumes and achieved our objective of several
hundred millions of dollars in revenue from HBM in ﬁscal year 2024.
Even as our DRAM gross margins improved, our ﬁscal Q4 HBM gross margins were
accretive to both company and DRAM gross margins, indicative of our solid HBM
yield ramp. W e expect to achieve HBM market share commensurate with our overall
DRAM market share sometime in calendar 2025.
We expect the HBM TAM to grow from approximately $4 billion in calendar 2023 to
over $25 billion in calendar 2025. As a percent of overall industry DRAM bits, we
expect HBM to grow from 1.5% in calendar 2023 to around 6% in calendar 2025. W e
have a robust roadmap for HBM and are conﬁdent we will maintain our time-to-
market, technology and power efﬁciency leadership with HBM4 and HBM4E.
During the quarter , Micron started shipments of production-capable HBM3E 12-high
36GB units to key industry partners to enable qualiﬁcations across the AI ecosystem.
Remarkably , Micron's HBM3E 12-high 36GB delivers 20% lower power consumption
than our competitors' HBM3E 8-high 24GB solutions while providing 50% higher
DRAM capacity .
We expect to ramp our HBM3E 12-high output in early calendar 2025 and increase
the 12-high mix in our shipments throughout 2025. As we have said before, our HBM
is sold out for calendar 2024 and 2025, with pricing already determined for this time
frame.
In calendar 2025 and 2026, we will have a more diversiﬁed HBM revenue proﬁle as
we have won business across a broad range of HBM customers with our industry-
leading HBM3E solution. W e see strong demand for our high-capacity D5 and LP5
solutions.
We are seeing increasing adoption of our high-capacity mono-die-based 128GB D5
DIMM products. W e are leveraging our innovative, industry-leading LP5 solutions to
pioneer the adoption of low-power DRAM for servers in the data center .
Micron's LP5 is speciﬁcally designed with data center and AI applications in mind,
offering unique features for enhanced reliability , availability and serviceability or RAS
in a server platform. W e are focused on LPDDR design innovation to optimize the
capacity , power and system reliability requirements of AI server infrastructure.
Data center SSD demand continues to be driven by strong growth in AI as well as a
recovery in traditional compute and storage. Our strategy to use greater levels of
vertical integration, including Micron-designed controllers and ﬁrmware has resulted
in a data center SSD portfolio that addresses customer requirements for a robust set
of features and functionality , competitive total cost of ownership and industry-leading
performance and quality .
We have gained substantial share in data center SSDs as a result. W e achieved a
quarterly revenue record with over a billion dollars in revenue in data center SSDs in
ﬁscal Q4, and our ﬁscal 2024 data center SSD revenues more than tripled from a
year ago.
Turning to PC. As discussed in our last earnings call, PC customers have built
inventories due to the rising memory price trajectory , anticipated growth in AI PCs as
well as an expectation of tight supply caused by an increasing portion of production
output being dedicated to meeting the growing data center demand.
As sell through of PCs continues at a steady pace with a seasonal increase in the
second half of calendar 2024, we expect healthier inventories at PC OEMs by spring
2025. PC unit volumes remain on track to grow in the low single-digit range for
calendar 2024. W e expect unit growth to continue in 2025 and accelerate into the
second half of calendar 2025, as the PC replacement cycle gathers momentum with
the rollout of next-gen-AI PCs, end of support for Windows 10 and the launch of
Windows 12.
The PC market is in the early stages of a transformation and we expect a signiﬁcant
shift towards AI-driven functionalities that promise to enhance user experiences and
productivity . AI PCs require a higher capacity of memory and storage. As an
example, leading PC OEMs have recently announced AI-enabled PCs with a
minimum of 16GB of DRAM for the value segment and between 32GB to 64GB for
the mid and premium segments, versus an average content across all PCs of around
12GB last year .
Micron is well positioned to support the growth of AI PCs with our portfolio of client
LPDRAM, DRAM and SSD products. Our low-power compression attached memory
module or LPCAMM2 product has had multiple design wins at leading PC OEMs.
These modules of fer all the beneﬁts of low-power DRAM in an upgradable form
factor .
Compared to the alternative modular D5 based solutions, LPCAMM2 provides up to
60% lower power and up to 70% better performance along with 60% space savings.
Our 3500 client SSD is qualiﬁed at all the major PC OEMs and provides the power-
performance enhancements needed for AI workloads.
Turning to mobile. Smartphone customer inventory dynamics are evolving in a
manner somewhat similar to that of PC customers. Smartphone unit volumes in
calendar 2024 are on track to grow in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range
and we expect unit growth to continue in 2025.
Smartphone OEMs are seeking to dif ferentiate their devices by incorporating more AI
features such as personalized recommendations, improved camera functionalities
and smarter voice assistants. Recently , leading Android smartphone OEMs have
announced AI-enabled smartphones with 12GB to 16GB of DRAM, versus an
average of 8GB in ﬂagship phones last year .
Micron is well positioned to support the growth of AI smartphones with our leading-
edge memory and storage products. During the quarter , we extended our product
leadership with the ﬁrst customer qualiﬁcation of our second-generation 1-beta
based LP5X DRAM and second-generation of G8 NAND UFS 4.0 products.
In the automotive market, infotainment and ADAS are driving long-term memory and
storage content growth. For the fourth consecutive year , Micron achieved a ﬁscal
year record for automotive revenue in 2024. Micron has built an industry-leading
portfolio of automotive-grade DRAM and NAND products that provide best-in-class
solutions for these high growth applications leveraging our technology and product
leadership, top quality rankings, and close customer collaborations.
During the quarter , we achieved qualiﬁcation of our 1-beta based 16Gb LP5 with 9.6
Gbps speed for the automotive market, which will support the increased performance
requirements driven by AI both in the digital cockpit and ADAS.
The automotive industry continues to adjust the mix of EV , hybrid and traditional
vehicles to meet evolving customer demand. As auto customer inventories adjust to
this new mix, we expect a resumption in our automotive growth in the second half of
ﬁscal 2025.
Now, turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2024 DRAM industry demand outlook
has improved, driven by strength in data center servers, and growth in the other
market segments has performed consistent with our prior market commentary .
Hence, we have upgraded our expectation for calendar 2024 industry DRAM bit
demand growth to now be in the high-teens percentage range. Our expectation for
calendar 2024 industry NAND bit demand growth remains in the mid-teens
percentage range. In calendar 2025, we expect both DRAM and NAND industry bit
demand growth to be around the mid-teens percentage range.
Turning to supply . Constructive industry conditions will help drive the considerable
improvements in proﬁtability and ROI that are needed to enable the investments
required to support future growth. Due to CapEx and supply reduction actions taken
across the industry in 2023, we expect industry wafer capacity in both DRAM and
NAND in 2024 to be below 2022 peak levels, and for NAND meaningfully so.
This factor combined with the increasing mix of HBM wafers is reducing DRAM
supply allocated to traditional products and contributing to the healthy industry
supply-demand environment that we expect for DRAM in calendar 2025.
Given the signiﬁcant reduction in industry wafer capacity in NAND and the ongoing
low NAND CapEx environment, we also expect a healthy industry supply-demand
environment for NAND in calendar 2025. NAND technology transitions generally
provide more growth in annualized bits per wafer compared to the NAND bit demand
CAGR expectation of high teens.
Consequently , we anticipate longer periods between industry technology transitions
and moderating capital investment over time to align industry supply with demand.
This can reduce both R&D expense growth and capital intensity in NAND over time,
which can contribute to the improved ﬁnancial health of the NAND industry .
Micron invested $8.1 billion in CapEx in ﬁscal 2024. W e expect ﬁscal 2025 CapEx to
be meaningfully higher and at around the mid-30s percentage range of revenue
based on our current CapEx and revenue expectations. The growth in both
greenﬁeld fab construction and HBM CapEx investments is projected to make up the
overwhelming majority of the year-over-year CapEx increase.
As a reminder , our investments in facility and construction in Idaho and New York will
support our long-term demand outlook for DRAM and will not contribute to bit supply
in ﬁscal 2025 and 2026. Micron will continue to exercise supply and CapEx discipline
and focus on improving proﬁtability , including walking away from less proﬁtable
business, while still maintaining our overall bit market share for DRAM and NAND.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone. In ﬁscal Q4, Micron delivered
revenue at the high end of the guidance range and gross margin and EPS above the
high end of the guidance ranges.
We are exiting the ﬁscal year with excellent momentum, having expanded our
industry-leading product portfolio, executed well on pricing, and improved our
ﬁnancial performance signiﬁcantly from the start of the year .
Total ﬁscal Q4 revenue was approximately $7.8 billion, up 14% sequentially and up
93% year-over-year . Fiscal 2024 total revenue was $25.1 billion, up 62% year-over-
year. Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $5.3 billion, up 93% year-over-year and
represented 69% of total revenue.
Sequentially , DRAM revenue increased 14%, with ﬂattish bit shipments and prices
increasing in the mid-teens percentage range. For the ﬁscal year , DRAM revenue
increased 60% year-over-year to $17.6 billion, representing 70% of total revenue.
Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $2.4 billion, up 96% year-over-year , and represented
31% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 15% sequentially , with bit
shipments increasing in the high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing
in the high single-digit percentage range.
Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was a new quarterly record for Micron. For the ﬁscal year ,
NAND revenue increased 72% year-over-year to $7.2 billion, representing 29% of
total revenue.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $3 billion, up 17% sequentially . Data center server DRAM achieved a
quarterly revenue record in ﬁscal Q4, driven by strong demand for high-capacity
solutions as well as our continued ramp of HBM.
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.9 billion, up 18% sequentially driven
by seasonal product ramps. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.7 billion,
up 24% sequentially and led by data center SSD, which reached a quarterly revenue
record.
We achieved record-high revenue for ﬁscal year 2024 for our NAND storage
business.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.2 billion, down 9% sequentially . In ﬁscal
2024, the automotive segment achieved a new ﬁscal year revenue record for the
fourth consecutive year .
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q4 was 36.5%, improving over eight
percentage points sequentially . Higher pricing and improved product mix were the
key drivers of the stronger proﬁtability . For the ﬁscal year , consolidated gross margin
was 23.7%, up over 31 percentage points year-over-year .
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q4 were $1.08 billion, up $105 million sequentially due
to an increase in R&D program expenses. For the ﬁscal year , operating expenses
were $4 billion, up 1 1% year-over-year . The increase in ﬁscal 2024 operating
expenses was primarily driven by an increase in R&D investments and reinstatement
of short-term incentive compensation.
We generated operating income of $1.7 billion in ﬁscal Q4, resulting in an operating
margin of approximately 23%, which was up nine percentage points sequentially and
up 53 percentage points from the year-ago quarter . Fiscal 2024 operating income
was $1.9 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 8%, which was up
39 percentage points year-over-year .
Fiscal Q4 adjusted EBITDA  was $3.7 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of 48%,
up ﬁve percentage points sequentially and up 30 percentage points from the year-
ago quarter . Fiscal 2024 EBITDA  was $9.7 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of
over 38%, which was up 20 percentage points year-over-year .
Fiscal Q4 taxes were $387 million and higher than our guide, largely due to a shift in
the jurisdictional mix of earnings. Fiscal 2024 taxes were $379 million or
approximately 20% of pretax income. Non-GAAP  diluted earnings per share in ﬁscal
Q4 was $1.18 compared to $0.62 per share in the prior quarter and a loss per share
of $1.07 in the year-ago quarter .
Fiscal Q4 non-GAAP  EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by
better pricing and proﬁtability . Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP  EPS was $1.30. Turning to
cash ﬂows and capital spending, our operating cash ﬂows were $3.4 billion in ﬁscal
Q4, representing 44% of revenue. For the ﬁscal year , we generated $8.5 billion of
operating cash ﬂows, representing 34% of revenue.
Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion during the quarter . CapEx totaled $8.1 billion
for the ﬁscal year , up from $7 billion in ﬁscal 2023. W e generated $323 million of free
cash ﬂow for the quarter and $386 million for the ﬁscal year .
As announced in early August, we determined that share repurchases may resume
in light of improved conditions. As such, with our return to free cash ﬂow , reduced
leverage and long-term positive outlook, we saw an opportunity to repurchase shares
in the quarter . In ﬁscal Q4, we repurchased $300 million or 3.2 million shares at an
average price of $93.07 per share.
Micron's ﬁscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.9 billion or 158 days, up three days from
the prior quarter . Micron continues to exercise pricing discipline and expects a
healthy supply-demand environment in the industry in ﬁscal 2025. W e intend to draw
down our inventory to support our revenue growth in ﬁscal 2025.
On the balance sheet, we held $9.2 billion of cash and investments at quarter-end
and maintained near $1 1.7 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit
facility . We ended the quarter with $13.4 billion in total debt, low net leverage and a
weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031. W e are committed to further
strengthening our balance sheet and sustaining our investment-grade credit rating.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal ﬁrst quarter . Fiscal Q1 gross margin is
projected to improve sequentially primarily on better pricing and portfolio mix. Recall
that, in ﬁscal Q4, HBM remained accretive to both DRAM and overall company gross
margins. W e project changes in our portfolio mix to continue to be an important and
favorable contributor to gross margins over time.
We forecast operating expenses to be ﬂat to slightly up in the ﬁscal ﬁrst quarter
compared to ﬁscal fourth quarter levels. For the full ﬁscal year 2025, we see
operating expenses growing by a mid-teens percentage versus ﬁscal 2024. Growth
in operating expenses is planned to be second half weighted, as we ramp necessary
R&D program investments, including for HBM, to capture the substantial growth
opportunity ahead.
For ﬁscal Q1 and ﬁscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP  tax rate to be in the mid-
teens percentage range. W e project days of inventory outstanding to decline in ﬁscal
2025 and for DIO to approach our target by the end of ﬁscal 2025. In ﬁscal Q1, we
forecast capital expenditures to increase sequentially to approximately $3.5 billion.
As Sanjay mentioned, we expect ﬁscal 2025 CapEx to be around mid-30s
percentage range of revenue based on our current CapEx and revenue expectations.
We remain circumspect with all capital spending and disciplined with WFE
investments in order to grow bit supply in line with industry demand.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q1 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $8.7 billion plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in
the range of 39.5% plus or minus 100 basis points and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.085 billion plus or minus $15 million.
As mentioned, we expect the ﬁscal Q1 tax rate to be in the mid-teens percentage
range. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14 billion shares, we expect EPS
to be $1.74 per share plus or minus $0.08.
In closing, we remain focused on investing in a disciplined manner to support our
growth and maintain stable bit share in DRAM and NAND. Micron is well positioned
to deliver record revenue as well as signiﬁcantly improved proﬁtability and free cash
ﬂow in ﬁscal 2025.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. Fiscal 2024 was a year of many records as we discussed earlier
and I expect ﬁscal 2025 to be even better . With the advent of AI, we are in the most
exciting period that I have seen for memory and storage in my career .
Micron's memory and storage innovations are enabling tremendous breakthroughs,
transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. Micron has
sustained multiple generations of technology leadership in DRAM and NAND.
Our unique culture and our industry-leading product portfolio, combined with our
world-class manufacturing execution and quality are enabling us to deliver
differentiated, high-value solutions across end markets. This has made us the
partner of choice for our customers as they plan their long-term roadmaps and our
momentum lays the foundation for an exciting ﬁscal 2025.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . Thank you. And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri
from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. Mark, I guess my ﬁrst question is, some of the assumptions in
guidance. I think you've been saying kind of on the conference circuit that bits would
be pretty ﬂat in ﬁscal Q1 for both DRAM and NAND. Is that what you're still assuming
so that most of the increase in the revenue is basically pricing? Is that correct?
Mark Murphy
Tim, what we see now and we had provided a slight update in August, but we now
see that DRAM bits, we expect to be up somewhat higher than what we had said
before. W e had said before they were going to be ﬂat and then we revised that to ﬂat
to slightly up and in this latest guide, we now view DRAM to be up somewhat higher
from that. NAND bits, we expect to be sequentially ﬂattish. Keep in mind that our
guide also contemplates a healthy supply-demand environment and an increasingly
favorable mix in the business with HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, LP , data center SSD.
So we see stronger data center demand and we had indicated that it was robust and
that's been favorable. And then we're just executing well on our product road maps,
our product execution, our overall manufacturing execution.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks, Mark. And then just one last thing. You had said that HBM revenue last
quarter in May was a little over $100 million. Can you give us the number in August?
Was it -- it looks like it was $300 million to $350 million something like that. Is that
about right for your HBM revenue in ﬁscal Q4?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we are not disclosing a speciﬁc revenue for FQ4. W e have said earlier that we will
have several hundred million dollars of revenue in ﬁscal year '24 and we achieved
that objective. And really very proud of all the execution from our team in terms of
putting in place the capacity , managing the yield ramp successfully to our goals, and
of course, continue to deliver a strong product to our customer base. So not
providing -- we're not going to be providing speciﬁcs on a quarter-by-quarter basis.
But keep in mind, yes, we delivered several hundred million dollars of revenue in
ﬁscal year '24 and we look forward to delivering multiple billions of dollars of revenue
of HBM in ﬁscal year '25.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . Thank you, Sanjay .
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor
Fitzgerald. Your question please.
C.J. Muse
Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess ﬁrst question on
gross margins. You guided up a robust 300 basis points. I was hoping you could
spend a little bit of time kind of walking us through what's driving that? How much is
from like-for-like DRAM ASP increases, mix, HBM yield improvements and cost
downs. And I guess, as you kind of walk through that, can you give us a ﬂavor of how
to think about those drivers beyond the November quarter?
Mark Murphy
So C.J., in the fourth or ﬁrst quarter , as we look at that margin expansion, it's similar
to the themes we've talked about before. The supply-demand environment is healthy .
So we're seeing that play through on -- in pricing. W e're also seeing the execution of
our product road map and the ramp of the higher-value products and that's
contributing. On costs, we are doing well on cost downs. However , in the ﬁrst quarter
because of the mix with HBM, we are going to see DRAM costs go up slightly . And
that's so as we look forward into the ﬁrst quarter , things are coming together as we
had hoped, tied at the leading edge, good supply demand, favorable pricing
environment and certainly favorable mix and that becoming a more important part of
the business and good cost execution.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful. And then I guess maybe as a follow-up, you've reiterated your CapEx
outlook, but obviously , the end market environment has changed a bit in the last
three months. So curious if you've changed your prioritization of CapEx at all?
Obviously , you talked about a focus on shelves and HBM. Any other change in terms
of your spending?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Not really . We don't have any other change. I mean again continuing to focus our
CapEx on HBM investment, which as you know , is a high-value solution and product
tends to be accretive to the margins. And of course, long-term construction CapEx,
and that is -- the construction CapEx that is targeted for longer term bit growth for the
second -- latter part of this decade.
C.J. Muse
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD
Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar
Yes, I have two questions. One, Sanjay , your AI GPU customers are moving to a
one-year cadence of your products. And it looks like the HBM road map is also
moving to that 12 months from a prior 18-month cadence. Do you think that this puts
you and your peers at a yield disadvantage, i.e., in other words, as HBM3E yield and
gross margin improves, you have to migrate to HBM4 and that new node might come
at a lower yield. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about that cadence of HBM
progression and how that impacts yield and gross margin? And then I had a quick
follow-up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
As we mentioned, we are doing well with respect to our goals on HBM3E yields with
8 high. And in '25, of course, we will be increased -- beginning our output in early
2025 with 12 high. And of course, 12 high will be going through its own yield ramp
and 12 high will be ramping through our calendar year '25 and HBM4 will be a 2026
product. And like any other new product, of course, there are in the early stages,
always ramp-up of yield involved. But we are very pleased with the technical
expertise that we have, manufacturing expertise and doing really quite well in terms
of continuing to ramp up the yield and the quality of our products. And at the end of
the day , you know , that cadence of -- our customers' cadence moving faster only
beneﬁts those who have the best product and technology because they are the ones
who are able to work with the customers at the pace that they need. And we are with
our HBM3E, which has demonstrated clear leadership in performance, in power and
overall product feature set for our customers, we absolutely plan to maintain that
leadership going forward with our road map from 8 high to 12 high of HBM3E and
HBM4 and 4E in the future years. Along with our expertise in manufacturing, that
should play to our strength in the time frame ahead. And we work very closely with
our customers.
Krish Sankar
Got it. V ery helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
We work very , very closely with our customers to understand their cadence, to
understand their requirements and make sure that our road map, both from
technology , product and manufacturing capabilities is aligned well with their
requirements.
Krish Sankar
Got it. Thanks a lot for that Sanjay . Super helpful color . And a quick follow-up for
Mark on inventory . I understand you're going to draw that down in FY'25. But just in
the last quarter , it went up, any color on where that inventory level is going up? Is
that within PCs? Is it mobile DRAM? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks a lot.
Mark Murphy
Sure. W e were clear about this in the August conferences that we were seeing --
while we were seeing robust data center demand, we were seeing some customers
had -- were buying ahead in anticipation of price increases, the rollout of AI-related
devices and just surety of supply , given that leading edge is tight. So we did see
some inventory build and we communicated that inventories would remain elevated
going into FY'25. So as what you see, so our days did go up. W e continue to be
prudent with our supply and walking away from less proﬁtable business. W e do
expect the environment, supply-demand environment to be constructive for improved
proﬁtability in '25. And given the tight leading-edge nodes and our outlook, we're
going to need these inventories to bridge us to when our production on tech node
transitions ramps. So that's why we've given an outlook that our inventories by the
end of the ﬁscal year , we expect to be approaching our target inventory levels. Now
our volumes happen to be a bit more second half weighted of the ﬁscal year . So we'll
see a bit shallower improvement at the ﬁrst half of the ﬁscal year and then that
improvement in DIO will steepen as we move through the second half. But we're
conﬁdent in our inventory outlook and deﬁnitely need these leading-edge inventories
to supply the market.
Krish Sankar
Thanks, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan
Stanley . Your question please.
Joseph Moore
Great. Thank you. In terms of your target for getting to HBM market share that's
more in line with your overall market share, can you kind of characterize how you get
there? Do you anticipate that it's still a supply-constrained environment for everybody
or are we sort of more -- a little bit more balanced in the quality of the Micron product
drives us through? Just what's the determinant of that market share that gets you to
that level?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, certainly , I mean we are being responsible and disciplined in terms of managing
our market share. W e have industry's best HBM3E product, and it's the best product
with 30% lower power with 8 high. And in fact when you go to 12 high, we are 20%
lower power despite 50% increase in capacity versus others 8 high products. So we
are well positioned with our product, with its performance, with this power . And that's
what is really putting us in the strong position of being -- product being sold out for
our '24 and '25 time frame. And when we look at HBM, we have talked about that
next year , we project a TAM of $25 billion, consuming about 6%, over 6% of the
industry best, in fact, a TAM of greater than $25 billion in 2025. And we are pretty
conﬁdent that with our product, with our yield ramp, and with the agreement that we
have in place with our customers, we will deliver sometime in 2025 get to our share
to be in line with our industry share. So of course, it's limited at this point by our
production ramp, but we are really on a very good trajectory there. So we feel very
conﬁdent with our product and with the production ramp and with share
opportunities. And frankly our HBM3E product is getting premium in the industry as
well versus other products. So it just puts us on a good trajectory ahead as well.
Joseph Moore
Great. Thank you. Congratulations.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of V ivek Arya from Bank of
America Securities. Your question please.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. Sanjay , on that same topic of
HBM, there is some concern about the potential for HBM oversupply in '25, let's say ,
there are three suppliers instead of the two that are right now . Is that something you
see that there is any potential for oversupply? And let's say if you take the other
scenario where there continue to be only two suppliers of NextGen HBM, do you
think the third supplier could ﬂood the market with additional DRAM, just sort of the
reverse of this trade ratio argument? So just curious to hear how you think about the
supply-demand dynamics for both traditional DRAM and HBM4 next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we certainly assume that the third supplier will ultimately succeed in having
HBM3E product as well and we'll have some share in the marketplace as well. And
again, as I pointed out earlier , with the solid product that we have, our product has
sold out through 2025 time frame and we are really well positioned with this product.
I think the part that you have to keep in mind is that leading-edge supply , as we have
mentioned here is tight. Leading-edge supply is tight because industry in '22, '23 time
frame with reductions in CapEx and CapEx-efﬁcient industry-wide transitions to the
newer technology nodes, the wafer capacity has come down from the peak levels in
meaningful ways. So the lower wafer capacity compared to the peak of 2022 as well
as the HBM 3:1 trade ratio, these are the ones that are overall keeping the industry
in a tight supply . And tight supply , not just for HBM, but also for non-HBM part of the
market. So we, of course, feel very good about our own plans with HBM. And of
course we always stay completely focused on managing the mix of our business
between non-HBM and HBM and remaining extremely disciplined about CapEx,
about our share objectives. W e have shared those share objectives about HBM here.
Overall, we have said we maintain our DRAM as well as NAND supply share to be
stable. And this is how we look at the overall market. But when you look at the
market trends, it's not just about demand trend on HBM, which is, of course, growing
substantially becoming more than $25 billion market in 2025. It's also about, past
spring, we see that demand for memory in smartphones and PCs as AI-enabled
smartphones become bigger and bigger part of the market in the quarters and the
years to come. And of course, customer inventories by spring time frame in
smartphone and PCs for memory get to earlier levels, we see that to be a driver of
demand as well to complement the strong data center demand. And we are looking
at strong momentum, not just with HBM. W e have talked about multiple billions of
dollars of revenue that we target to generate in our ﬁscal year 2025 from high-
capacity DRAM modules as well as LP  memory in data center , so these are all the
elements that point to strong demand trends and demand trends driven by AI in data
center as well as in smartphone and PCs where more and more content is required
in an environment where the leading-edge supply is today tight. So I think the
opportunity is tremendous and we see healthy demand supply balance and a
constructive environment for our ﬁnancial performance in ﬁscal 2025. And that's why
we say with conﬁdence that we'll deliver a substantial revenue record in ﬁscal year
2025, the signiﬁcant improvement in our proﬁtability as well.
Vivek Arya
Got it. V ery helpful. And maybe a quick follow-up for Mark. Mark, on the Q3 call, I
think you were a little more explicit about both industry pricing and your gross
margins expanding through ﬁscal '25. Is that still a useful construct from where you
see -- from what you see today or do you think there is a scenario where gross
margins or your pricing start to ﬂatten out or even go in the other direction through
ﬁscal '25? What is the operating assumption for ﬁscal '25 as you see it right now?
Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Maybe just following up here to draw on Sanjay's comments. I mean we see a very
positive setup in ﬁscal '25 and so had said substantial revenue record signiﬁcantly
improved proﬁtability . The supply-demand setup is quite good. The market's leading-
edge is very tight. As we've talked about, the industry wafer capacity has come
down, and so in HBM, of course, is creating supply constraints in the marketplace as
share bits increase. So we still see that the supply-demand environment is healthy
through the year . We also are constructive for the year . We also see the trend we've
talked about that our volume is increasingly moving to support higher-value ad
products with our dif ferentiated portfolio. So HBM, high-capacity DIMMs, more LP
and then our NAND SSD for data center portfolio products. So I think the margin
expansion through the year supported by those elements and continued good cost
performance gives us conﬁdence on a very good year .
Vivek Arya
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman
Sachs. Your question please.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you. I had a two-part question on the HBM business. Sanjay , you talked about
you all being sold out through calendar '25. I'm curious if there's an opportunity for
Micron to present upside or deliver upside to what the plan is currently for '25 or are
equipment lead times such that you're essentially capped vis-a-vis what your
expectations are today for HBM speciﬁcally . And then my second part is on gross
margin for HBM. W e all understand that the business is accretive to both the
corporate average and also relative to DRAM. As you look forward into calendar '25
with volumes locked in and pricing locked in, I would assume you've got decent
visibility on gross margin. Should we expect HBM gross margins to stay kind of
where they are or could they move further up as long as you execute on the yield
side? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So regarding your part of your question on the upside for HBM in 2025. So again let
me emphasize that we are extremely focused on delivering our goals of getting to
our share in HBM to be in line with DRAM share sometime in 2025, extremely
focused on continuing to ramp up our production capacity and yield ramp, which are
going well according to our plan. I'm very pleased with that. So remaining focused on
that. And of course if there are opportunities to be opportunistic, with any upside, of
course, we will be capturing those. And those upsides always remain. And yields, we
expect to get to mature yields on our HBM in ﬁscal year '25. Yields are always an
upside opportunity , productivity of the equipment always can be an opportunity as
well. So we'll manage our business responsibly and with total focus on delivering to
our goals and maintaining our focus on keeping our HBM commitments to our
customers coming through successfully . Now regarding your questions on gross
margin being accretive, yes, we would expect our HBM business to be accretive for
our ﬁscal year 2025. Beyond that really not providing any further details. And, yes,
you are right that our volume and pricing for HBM is locked up for 2024 as well as for
2025 time frame, calendar year 2024 and calendar year 2025.
Toshiya Hari
Great. And then as a quick follow-up on DRAM industry bit growth. I think you raised
your '24 outlook to high-teens and you gave a preliminary '25 outlook of mid-teens.
I'm curious what's driving the decel from '24 to '25. Is the '25 number a supply-
constrained number . From a demand perspective, Sanjay , you sounded pretty
constructive on PCs and smartphones and obviously , the content opportunity , and
you remain pretty positive on data centers. So I'm just curious what's driving the
expected decel in '25. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes. W e'll just point, I mean, by the way , we have, in the past, talked about DRAM
CAGR being mid-teens. At 2024, we have increased the outlook to high-teens based
on the strength in the data center . And 2025 as we look at it just keep, in fact, mind
two factors. One is we are now comparing it to the higher base of 2024, which has
gone to high-teens. So that, of course, impact the percentage of the '25. And second
piece is that, as we have noted, that smartphone and PC, which at the end market
level are continuing to do ﬁne. But given for the three factors that we have mentioned
in our earnings call script that the customers built some inventory . The sell-in is
somewhat less than their sellout in terms of memory and we have said that by spring
of 2025, we expect in PCs customer inventory levels to get to healthier levels versus
now and these will continue to improve. So that too plays a factor . And of course I
would just like to remind you that we have pointed out that overall smartphone and
PC unit growth will be occurring in 2025 and of course increasing penetration of AI
phones and second half that acceleration, that growth will be obviously stronger than
the ﬁrst half. So all of these factors are included in our current outlook of 2025 DRAM
growth being in mid-teens. And let me just point out that previously we have said that
HBM, we would expect it to be greater than $20 billion opportunity in 2025. W e have
now said HBM is more than $25 billion opportunity in 2025. So as you know HBM
has a trade ratio of 3:1, it takes three times as many wafers to produce the same bit
as standard products in the technology nodes. So obviously the growth of HBM also
impacts the total bit growth year-over-year in aggregate.
Toshiya Hari
