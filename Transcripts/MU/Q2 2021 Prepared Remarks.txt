Highlights   
Micron delivered strong FQ2 results above our original projections driven by solid execution and higher -
than-expected demand across multiple end markets. The DRAM market is in severe shortage, and the NAND 
market is showing signs of stabilization in the near term. The execution from the Micron team and these 
strengthened conditions enabled us to set revenue records for Mobile MCPs and automotive products, and 
to reach normal levels of inventory ahead of sche dule. Following last quarter’s introduction of 176 -layer 
NAND into volume production, in FQ2, we began volume production on our 1 -alpha DRAM node, 
solidifying our technology leadership in both DRAM and NAND.  We are in an excellent position to capitalize 
on the strong demand for memory and storage driven by artificial intelligence and 5G across the data 
center, the intelligent edge, and user devices.

 I will start with an update on our operations. The Micron team is doing everything we can to meet  customer 
demand despite the challenges of the pandemic, non -memory component shortages in the electronics -
industry, and disruptions that occurred in our Taiwan fabs in December. We are confident that our COVID -
19 safety protocols will allow us to continue  at full production levels, and we are encouraged to see vaccines 
become increasingly available around the world.  Micron has been able to mitigate the impact of broad 
electronics -industry shortages to our production output through our proactive supply cha in and inventory 
management strategies. Investments made over the last several years in facilities infrastructure allowed us 
to minimize lost output caused by the power outage and earthquake at our Taiwan operations in December.  
Recently, due to the droug ht in central Taiwan, there has been a reduction in the water supply for one of 
our DRAM fab sites. To mitigate the water shortage, we are accelerating our water conservation efforts and 
have secured alternative sources of water.  At this time, we do not s ee an impact to DRAM production 
output; however, this is a developing situation that we are monitoring closely for the next several months.  
Tech nology & Product Leadership  
Now turning to technology and products:  
We continue to make solid progress on our k ey goals: first, to deliver industry -leading technology and 
improve our cost structure; second, to bring differentiated products to market and improve our product 
mix; and third, to grow our share of industry profits while maintaining stable bit share.  
I am proud to report that Micron was one of the top 20 U.S. patent registrants in 2020. This achievement 
attests to the brilliant innovation of our teams and is proof of the tenacious focus we have placed on 
technology and product leadership over the past sev eral years.  
Our industry -leading 1 -alpha DRAM and 176 -layer NAND nodes are in volume production and are ramping 
on plan. We expect these nodes to be our workhorse for FY22, fueling our bit growth and contributing to 
our long -term cost reduction  goals. Across both DRAM and NAND, we target long term cost reductions 
that are in -line with the industry.  
In products, Micron is on track to support customers as they begin to introduce DDR5 in the fiscal second 
half of 2021. We are also driving an incr eased mix of QLC NAND, which helps to make SSDs more cost -
effective and accelerates the replacement of HDDs with SSDs. QLC SSD adoption continues to grow, and 
we achieved a record high QLC bit mix in FQ2. Earlier this month, Micron took a decisive step to exit 3D 
XPoint development and manufacturing. As mentioned on our recent 3D XPoint update call, Micron is 
prioritizing investment toward other memory solutions that use the Compute Express Link, or CXL, and we 
are excited about addressing this market oppor tunity with differentiated products. Most of the R&D teams 
previously working on 3D XPoint have already been transitioned to other programs, including accelerating

 introduction of CXL -enabled memory products. This change will allow Micron to better address  future needs 
of our data center customers and also drive higher ROI and shareholder value.  
We are running an open process to identify the best acquirer for the Lehi fab which provides an excellent 
location for advanced foundry, logic, and analog semiconductor manufacturing, and expect to finalize the 
sale within calendar 2021. We anticipate that  the overwhelming majority of the highly skilled Lehi 
manufacturing team will find strong career opportunities with the buyer.  
End Market Highlights  
Turning to end markets:  
Data Center  
In data center, AI and data -centric workloads will drive long -term gro wth, with memory and storage 
becoming an increasing portion of server BOM cost.  Micron is positioned for success in this market, with a 
broad portfolio of high -quality and power -efficient products.  Enterprise demand, which had been anemic 
for the last fe w quarters, is starting to improve as IT budgets increase in anticipation of economic recovery. 
Enterprise DRAM bit shipments grew sharply quarter  –over-quarter but were still down year -over-year.  
Cloud DRAM bit shipments also grew quarter -over-quarter, and we anticipate robust demand from U.S. 
hyperscale customers, especially as we enter the second half of calendar 2021.   
In data center SSDs, revenue declined sequentially as customers in certain segments reduced their higher -
than-average invent ory levels. We are continuing to expand our data center NVMe SSD portfolio with 
internally developed controllers and have new product introductions planned in the coming quarters.  
PC 
In PC, we continue to benefit from the remote work and learning trend th at drove healthy notebook and 
Chromebook demand in FQ2. Micron delivered record PC DRAM bit shipments despite pockets of non -
memory component shortages  experienced in the PC OEM supply chain. We also began sampling 1 -alpha -
based DDR4 products.   
In client SSDs, we are on track to begin customer qualification of our next -generation client SSDs using 176 -
layer NAND in the fiscal second half of 2021. By the end of calendar 2021, we expect to cover multiple 
segments of the market , including consumer, va lue OEM and premium OEM with our 176 -layer -based client 
portfolio.

 Graphics  
In graphics, revenue declined quarter over quarter from an exceptional FQ1, which benefited from the 
launch of new gaming consoles. Nevertheless, FQ2 revenue grew significantly year -over-year. Micron has 
an excellent position in this market, with a broad product portfolio and deep customer partnerships.  
Mobile  
In mobile, revenue grew 21% sequentially , driven by strong execution coupled with better -than-seasonal 
demand due to continuing recovery in smartphone volumes. We achieved record MCP revenue, and nearly 
tripled our LP5 revenue sequentially. We have also begun sampling the industry’s first 1 -alpha  LPDRAM and 
176-layer NAND with mobile customers. Smartphone unit sales in China have been robust , and 5G 
momentum is continuing.  
Auto  
In auto, we delivered a second consecutive record -revenue quarter as auto manufacturing recovers around 
the globe and as  memory and storage content per vehicle continues to grow.  We have more demand than 
we can supply, and we are working diligently with our customers to address their memory and storage 
needs. We are also advancing our product portfolio targeted for automot ive applications. In FQ2, we 
completed qualification of our auto -grade LP5 and began sampling the industry’s first automotive LP5 that 
is hardware -evaluated to meet the most stringent Automotive Safety Integrity Level, ASIL D.    
Industry Outlook  
Turning to the market outlook, calendar 2021 is shaping up to be a solid year, and our overall outlook across 
DRAM and NAND has improved since our last earnings call, with broad strength across nearly all end 
markets.  The pandemic has driven changes in ou r economy that we believe will not only benefit us this 
year, but also serve to accelerate the digital transformation of the economy and drive new opportunities for 
Micron. Recovery from the pandemic and pent -up demand are expected to drive strong demand g rowth in 
markets such as enterprise, cloud, desktop PCs, mobile, auto and industrial.  
Data center demand is expected to be strong in calendar 2021, particularly in the second half of the calendar 
year, due to a combination of factors: First, enterprise dem and has started to come back as the economy 
recovers and is expected to further strengthen through the calendar year. Second, our opportunity at cloud 
service providers will continue to strengthen through calendar 2021, driven by robust demand for their 
solutions and offerings, as well as secular growth in AI and data -centric workloads. And finally, the 
introduction of new CPUs will support more memory channels and higher -density modules, contributing to 
increases in server memory content across both clou d and enterprise.

 Forecasts for calendar 2021 PC unit sales have increased from three months ago and are expected to 
approach an average of one million units per day. There is robust demand in notebook PCs, especially 
Chromebooks. We also expect the deskto p market to improve as workers gradually return to the office this 
year. Mobile unit sales are expected to show robust growth this year, and we also expect to benefit from 
higher content in 5G phones, which are forecast to double in calendar 2021 to more t han 500 million units. 
Auto unit sales are expected to grow significantly from last year , while secular memory and storage content 
growth trends remain strong as EVs proliferate.  
The strong demand across various end markets , combined with disruptions at c ertain logic and foundry 
semiconductor producers , has resulted in a shortage of these non -memory ICs for our customers, and we 
believe memory demand would have been even greater without these shortages.  
In DRAM, due to the stronger demand, we now expect calendar 2021 bit growth at 20%, above our prior 
forecast of high teens. This growth builds on calendar 2020 bit growth , which was in the lower 20 % range.  
As a result of disciplined CapEx investm ents since the start of the pandemic, we expect industry DRAM 
supply to be below demand. As a result of the strong demand and limited supply, the DRAM market is 
currently facing a severe undersupply, which is causing DRAM prices to increase rapidly. We see  the DRAM 
market tightening further through the year.  
In NAND, we now expect calendar 2021 bit growth in the low to mid -30% range, above our prior expectation 
of 30%. While we are seeing stabilization in near -term pricing, the elevated levels of industry  CapEx are a 
cause for concern, and more CapEx cuts are needed to allow for healthy NAND industry profitability.  
Long term, we expect a DRAM bit demand growth CAGR of mid - to high teens and a NAND bit demand 
growth CAGR of approximately 30%  
Micron Outlook  
Turning to Micron supply, we target our long -term bit supply growth CAGR to be in line with the industry 
bit demand growth CAGR for both DRAM and NAND. However, there can be year -to-year variability 
caused by node -transition timing. In both DRAM and NAND,  we expect our calendar 2021 bit supply 
growth to be below the industry demand growth, and we have used our inventory to add to our bit 
shipment growth this year. We are targeting fiscal 2021 CapEx to be approximately $9 billion to support 
our long -term go al of maintaining a stable share of industry bit supply.   
I will now turn it over to Dave.

 DAVE ZINSNER , SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER   
Thanks Sanjay.  
OPENING  
Micron delivered very strong FQ2 results, with solid revenue growth, margin expansion, and positive free 
cash flow.  Market conditions improved throughout the quarter, and DRAM and NAND volumes , as well as 
DRAM pricing , were above our original expectations.  
LEHI  /3D XPoint  
Before discussing the details of our fiscal second quarter results, I want to discuss the financial impact of 
our decision to cease 3D XPoint development and manufacturing. As a result of this decision, we wrote -off 
$49 million of 3D XPoint inventory in our FQ2 GAAP financial r esults.  This inventory exceeded our needs to 
fulfill customer commitments. We remain committed to fulfilling our customer commitments to 
manufacture 3D XPoint wafers and currently expect modest revenues, consistent with recent history until 
the end of cal endar 2021.  
Our Lehi fab was recategorized at the end of FQ2  as “held for sale” on our balance sheet, and beginning in 
FQ3, depreciation expense for the building and related equipment will stop. As a result, FQ3 gross margins 
will benefit from approximate ly $75 million of lower depreciation expense. The remaining costs will continue 
until the closing of the sale of our 3D XPoint fab in  Lehi, Utah.  
As we discussed on our 3D XPoint update call, Micron will continue to maintain our current R&D investment 
level and redeploy the 3D XPoint R&D teams to work on technologies and products that align with our 
vision for memory and storage. We have already made progress on this front since our update call.  
Now, moving on to our results for FQ2. 
REVENUE  
Total FQ2 revenue was approximately $6.24 billion, up 8% quarter –over quarter and up 30% year -over-
year. We saw solid growth in most of our end markets , notably in the data center, mobile, PC, auto  and 
industrial markets.  
DRAM

 FQ2 DRAM rev enue was $4.4 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 10% 
sequentially and was up 44% year -over-year. Bit shipments grew in the high single -digit percentage range 
sequentially, and ASPs were up slightly quarter -over-quarter.  
NAND  
FQ2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.7 billion, representing 26% of total revenue. NAND revenue 
increased 5% sequentially and was up 9% year -over-year. Bit shipments increased in the high single -digit 
percentage range sequentially, while A SPs declined in the low single -digit percentage range quarter -over-
quarter, showing an improvement in trajectory in the NAND pricing environment.  
REVENUE BY BUSINESS UNIT  
Now turning to our revenue trends by business unit.  
Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was approximately $2.6 billion, up approximately 
4% sequentially and up 34% year -over-year. Revenue growth was broad -based and driven by a combination 
of volume and pricing across data center, networking and client.  
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.8 billion, up 21% sequentially and up 44% year -over-year. 
Mobile demand remains strong as 5G momentum increases and the mobile market continues to recover 
from the impact of the pandemic.  
Revenue for the Storage Business U nit was $850 million, down approximately 7% from the prior quarter 
and down 2% year over year.  Both SSD revenue and component revenue declined sequentially. We expect 
our storage revenue to increase as we introduce our 176 -layer client SSDs into volume production.  
Finally, the Embedded Business Unit generated record revenue of $935 million, which was up 16% 
sequentially and 34% year -over-year, driven by strong industrial demand and record auto revenue as 
demand recovered from pandemic -related shutdowns.  
OPERATING RESULTS  
GROSS MARGIN  
The consolidated gross margin for FQ2 was 32.9%, up 200 basis points from the prior quarter. DRAM price 
increases and cost declines drove the  margin expansion in FQ2. For fiscal 2021, due to product mix changes, 
we now expect that our DRAM cost reductions will be somewhat higher than our prior expectations of mid -
single digits, while our NAND cost reductions will be somewhat lower than our prio r expectation of low to 
mid-teens.

 OPEX  
Operating expenses were $797 million in FQ2. Operating expenses were slightly lower than our expectation 
as prequal expenses were less than we had anticipated. We continue to expect operating expenses to 
increase in  the second half of the fiscal year as we incur increased prequalification and labor expenses. As 
always, we remain committed to tightly managing expenses.  
OPERATING INCOME  
FQ2 operating income was $1.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 20%, compared to 17% in the 
prior quarter and 11% in the prior year’s quarter.  
FQ2 EBITDA was $2.8 billion, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 45%, compared to 43% in the prior quart er 
and 40% in the prior year.  
NET INTEREST EXPENSE  
Net interest expense improved to $24 million, and we expect it to be approximately $25 million in FQ3.  
TAXES  
Our FQ2 effective tax rate was 10.1%. We expect our tax rate to be in the high single digits fo r fiscal 2021.  
EARNINGS PER SHARE  
Non-GAAP earnings per share in FQ2 were $0.98, up from $0.78 in FQ1 and up from $0.45 in the year -ago 
quarter. EPS included one cent of nonoperating income related to gains from investments in our venture 
arm, Micron Vent ures.  
OPERATING CASH FLOW  
Turning to cash flows and capital spending, we generated approximately $3.1 billion in cash from operations 
in FQ2, representing 49% of revenue.  
CAPITAL ALLOCATION  
Net capital spending was approximately $2.9 billion during the quarter. Through the first six months of the 
fiscal year, we have deployed approximately $5.7 billion or slightly less than two -thirds of our expected 
annual capital spending. As we look ahead to the second half of the fiscal year, we expect capital spending 
to decline from the first half and continue to target approximately $9 billion in total for FY21.   
 
 
Micron Technology, Inc.  
Fiscal Q 2 2021 Earnings Call  Prepared Remarks

 As a result of our strong cash flow from operations of $3.1 billion, we generated positive  free cash flow of 
$174 million despite the relatively high level of capital spending in the quarter. The increased cash flow was 
driven by strong revenue growth and efficient working capital management. We expect free cash flow to 
continue to improve in t he second half of the fiscal year, driven by continued revenue growth, higher 
margins and lower capital spending. While we did not have share repurchases in FQ2, we will begin 
repurchasing shares in the third quarter and remain committed to returning at le ast 50% of annual free cash 
flow to shareholders in FY21.  
INVENTORY  
Ending FQ2 inventory was $4.7 billion or 99 days, which reflects the inventory reporting changes we 
announced on last quarter’s earnings call.  
TOTAL CASH/DEBT  
We ended the quarter with to tal cash of $8.6 billion and total liquidity of approximately $11.1 billion. FQ2 
ending total debt was $6.6 billion.  
OUTLOOK  
Now turning to our outlook. DRAM prices have started to strengthen, and we expect the market to remain 
undersupplied this calendar year. In addition, NAND conditions are stabilizing. These improving market 
conditions, combined with our significantly stronger competitive position, set us up to generate stellar 
financial results in the second half of the fiscal and calendar year.  
While  demand is strong across both the DRAM and NAND markets, our supply is now constrained as our 
inventories are very lean, particularly in DRAM. This restricts our ability to serve potential upside to demand. 
On the cost side, we are facing additional headwi nds due to foreign exchange rates and drought mitigation 
impacting our Taiwan operations, and as result our FQ3 DRAM costs could be sequentially up. We are also 
assuming that there is no impact to our production output due to the Taiwan drought.  
NON -GAAP  GUIDANCE  
With all these factors in mind, our non -GAAP guidance for FQ3 is as follows. We expect revenue to be $7.1 
billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of 41.5% plus or minus 100 basis points; 
and operating expenses to be a pproximately $875 million, plus or minus $25 million. Finally, based on a 
share count of approximately 1.16 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.62, plus or minus 
$0.07.

 In closing, as we reflect on our financial performance for F Y20, which was a trough year for Micron in this 
cycle, and compare it to the prior trough in FY16, I am amazed by how far we have come. From FY16 to 
FY20, we substantially improved our EBITDA margin and our revenue grew by more than 70%.  During this 
time,  we delivered average gross margins of 40%, EBITDA margins of 50% and return on invested capital of 
20%. We believe Micron’s strong performance will continue cross -cycle and outperform the broader 
semiconductor industry.  
I will now turn it back to Sanjay.  
Sanjay Mehrotra, President and Chief Executive Officer  
Thank you, Dave.    
None of our achievements are possible without the great work of our world -class Micron team. We seek to 
recognize and reward team member performance and to do so fairly.  Last week, we announced that we 
achieved comprehensive global pay equity in total employee compensation across base pay, bonuses and 
stock rewards for women an d all underrepresented groups at Micron.  Pay equity is a key pillar of our 
diversity, equality, and inclusion strategy and core to creating an environment that attracts and retains the 
best talent. We continue to strengthen Micron’s inclusive, values -driven culture, which is an integral part of 
our broader transformation.  
We have come a long way since Micron’s founding as a startup in Boise, Idaho more than 40 years ago , and 
today we are a global technology and product leader.   As the United States’ only  remaining memory and 
storage manufacturer, we welcome the U.S. government’s commitments to enhance America’s long -term 
technology leadership and competitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing. This emphasis on our industry 
– which is reflected by governme nts globally – is a recognition of the critical role we play in today’s digital 
economy.  
Memory and storage represent approximately 30% of semiconductor industry revenue today, up from 10% 
in the early 2000s, and DRAM and NAND are growing in importance as a critical enabler of the most 
advanced technologies driving economic growth and well -being.  Micron’s innovation over the decades has 
created a strong foundation, and we look forward to delivering value for all our stakeholders as the data 
economy acce lerates.   
Thank you for joining and for your support of Micron. We will now move to Q&A.
