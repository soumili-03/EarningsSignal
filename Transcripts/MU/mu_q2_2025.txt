Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. Micron is in the best competitive
position in our history , and we are achieving share gains across high-margin product
categories in our industry . Our strong product momentum has enabled us to build
deeper customer relationships, and Micron's industry-leading products are now more
ﬁrmly entrenched in our customers' high-value product roadmaps.
In ﬁscal Q2, data center DRAM revenue reached a new record. HBM revenue grew
more than 50% sequentially to a new milestone of over $1 billion of quarterly
revenue. Our HBM shipments were ahead of our plans, demonstrating strong
execution of our ongoing ramp. The combination of our revenue from high-capacity
DRAM modules and our industry-leading LPDRAM for the data center also exceeded
the $1 billion milestone for the quarter .
Micron remains the only company in the world to ship low-power DRAM into the data
center in high volume, showcasing our pioneering innovation and deep partnership
with our customers for dif ferentiated solutions. As we build on this momentum, we
expect ﬁscal Q3 revenue to be another record for Micron, driven by shipment growth
across both DRAM and NAND.
We see the combination of AI data center demand and the ramp of HBM and its
associated trade ratio contributing to tightness at the leading edge and constraining
non-HBM DRAM supply . We expect supply actions announced by NAND companies
to improve the dynamics in the NAND market.
Micron's 1-beta DRAM technology leads the industry , and we are extending our
leadership with the launch of our 1-gamma node and the industry's ﬁrst shipments of
1-gamma-based D5 products last month. Micron's 1-gamma is our ﬁrst DRAM node
incorporating EUV , and we have achieved 20% lower power , 15% better
performance and over 30% improvement in bit density compared to our 1-beta
DRAM.
Micron's leading-edge Gen9 NAND technology node delivers the industry's fastest
TLC-based NAND, and we are managing the ramp of this node, mindful of the
supply-demand balance in the industry . Micron continues to make disciplined
investments that position us to capitalize on the signiﬁcant growth opportunities
driven by AI. W e are focused on growing HBM capacity in our existing manufacturing
facilities to meet requirements through 2026.
In January , we broke ground on an HBM advanced packaging facility in Singapore.
This investment allows us to meaningfully expand our total advanced packaging
capacity beginning in calendar 2027. Our new DRAM fab construction in Idaho
completed an important construction milestone that enabled the receipt of the ﬁrst
disbursement of funding from our CHIPS grant for the project during the quarter . This
new Idaho fab will provide meaningful DRAM output starting in ﬁscal 2027.
Turning to our end markets. Dramatic improvements in computation hardware have
reduced the per-token cost of generative AI models. These hardware improvements,
along with more efﬁcient algorithms and software, drive down the cost of inference
and make generative AI-based capabilities more accessible to new applications and
use cases.
This broadening deployment creates a powerful growth vector for aggregate AI
demand, and recent innovations and those in the pipeline from key contributors to
the AI ecosystem will continue to fuel this growth trend.
As GPU and custom AI accelerate our performance capabilities continue to improve
with each new generation of product, these high-performance processors are starved
of memory bandwidth. HBM memory provides the bandwidth necessary to leverage
these powerful processors in the most ef fective and efﬁcient manner , and we are
excited to see the growth opportunities ahead for this complex and high-value
product category where our customers now recognize Micron as the HBM
technology leader in our industry .
Recently , large hyperscale customers reiterated strong year-over-year growth for
their capital investments in calendar 2025. W e project mid-single-digit server unit
growth in calendar 2025, with growth in both traditional and AI servers.
We see strong demand for HBM and have once again increased our HBM TAM
estimate for calendar 2025 to over $35 billion. W e remain on track to reach HBM
share similar to our overall DRAM supply share on a run rate basis in calendar Q4
2025. As previously mentioned, Micron has sold out of our HBM output in calendar
2025. W e are seeing strong demand for our HBM supply in 2026 and are in
discussions with our customers on agreements for their calendar 2026 HBM
demand.
Micron's industry-leading HBM3E delivers a 30% power reduction compared to the
competition. And our HBM3E 12-high has a remarkable 20% power advantage over
competing 8-high products while providing a 50% higher memory capacity . We have
begun volume production of HBM3E 12-high and are focused on ramping capacity
and yield. W e anticipate HBM3E 12-high will comprise the vast majority of our HBM
shipments in the second half of calendar 2025.
We are making good progress on additional platform and customer qualiﬁcations
with HBM. Micron's HBM3E 8-high is designed into NVIDIA's GB200 system, and our
HBM3E 12-high is designed into the GB300. In ﬁscal Q2, we initiated volume
shipments to our third large HBM3E customer and anticipate additional customers
over time. W e expect multibillion dollars in HBM revenue in ﬁscal 2025.
Looking ahead, we are enthusiastic about Micron's HBM4, which will ramp in volume
in calendar 2026. Our HBM4 provides a bandwidth increase of over 60% compared
to HBM3E. The timing of our HBM4 is aligned to our customers' requirements, and
we are focused on delivering the best HBM4 products to the market across power
efﬁciency , quality and performance.
Our proven HBM product performance, our strong HBM road map and our
demonstrated manufacturing excellence uniquely positioned Micron to capitalize on
next-generation HBM4 and HBM4E solutions. Micron has led the adoption of LP  in
data center . In AI servers, Micron's LP  lowers memory power consumption by over
2/3 compared to D5.
We expect to maintain our leadership position in LP  for server as it transitions from
soldered components to SOCAMM, or Small Outline Compression Attached Memory
Module form factor . Micron's SOCAMM was developed in collaboration with NVIDIA
to support the GB300. LPDRAM in a SOCAMM form factor enables easier server ,
manufacturability and serviceability and helps drive broader LP  adoption in the
server market. W e are on track to deliver multibillion dollars in revenue in ﬁscal 2025
from our portfolio of high-capacity D5 modules and LP  products for the data center .
In data center NAND, demand moderated in ﬁscal Q2 due to short-term customer
inventory-driven impacts, and we see a return to bit shipment growth in the months
ahead. In calendar Q4 2024, based on industry analyst reports, Micron achieved yet
another record high market share in data center SSDs with revenue growth in each
category , including performance, mainstream and capacity SSDs.
Our high-performance 9550 SSD, which is on NVIDIA  GB200 NVL72-approved
vendor list, completed qualiﬁcations at multiple customers. During the quarter , we
announced that Micron's data center class G8 QLC-based NAND components are
qualiﬁed for production in pure storages, high-capacity 150-terabyte DirectFlash
module.
Micron's data center class NAND components give customers the ability to leverage
our industry-leading NAND design and process technology in their custom storage
solutions. Micron's leadership in QLC NAND supports the transition from HDD to
NAND solutions in the data center . We expect to generate multiple billions of dollars
in data center NAND revenue and once again grow our data center NAND market
share in calendar 2025.
We expect the PC market to grow mid-single digits in unit terms in calendar 2025,
with growth weighted to the second half of calendar 2025. The Windows 10 end of
life in October 2025, combined with an aging installed base and the desire amongst
customers to ensure that their PC hardware specs can support compelling AI
applications in the future, are key catalysts that drive this growth.
AI PCs required a minimum of 16 gigabytes of DRAM, with many models requiring
even higher memory versus the average 12 gigabyte PC content last year . During
the quarter , we sampled our 16-gigabit 1 gamma-based D5 products to PC clients. In
NAND, we launched our Gen9 based 4600 performance SSDs, the fastest in the
world for the client market, and completed qualiﬁcations of our 2650 mainstream
SSDs at multiple PC OEMs.
Turning to mobile. Our expectations for smartphone unit volume growth in calendar
2025 remain at low single-digit percentages. Smartphone customer inventory
dynamics have played out as anticipated, leading to mobile DRAM and NAND bit
shipment growth in our ﬁscal Q3. AI adoption continues to be a signiﬁcant driver for
increased mobile DRAM demand.
AI-capable ﬂagship phones increasingly feature DRAM capacities of 12 gigabyte or
higher compared to the 8 gigabyte in last year's models. Smartphone OEMs are
using Micron's industry-leading 9.6 gigabit per second LP5X DRAM to improve AI
performance, delivering up to 20% more tokens per second than those using legacy
speed grades on the same SoC.
During the quarter , we announced that our LP5X DRAM and UFS 4.0 NAND were
featured in the high end of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Series. Micron's mobile DRAM
and UFS storage solutions are in high demand and will continue to launch in ﬂagship
and high-end smartphones throughout the year . Additionally , we are now sampling
the industry's ﬁrst mobile G9 managed NAND-based UFS 4.1 solution in densities of
1 terabyte.
Automotive OEMs, industrial and consumer embedded customers are in the later
stages of adjusting their inventory levels. In automotive, which comprises the largest
portion of our EBU revenue, memory and storage content per car continues to
increase as AI-enabled in-vehicle infotainment systems become more enriched and
driver assistance functions become more capable.
Advanced robotaxi platforms today contain over 200 gigabytes of DRAM, or 20x to
30x higher than the amount of DRAM in the average car . Micron is well-positioned to
capitalize on this trend with our industry-leading portfolio of automotive products.
During the quarter , we announced the production readiness of the industry's ﬁrst
automotive LP5X DRAM product that supports the 9.6 gigabits per second speed
grid, addressing the increasing performance requirements of AI-driven applications in
vehicles. Additionally , our 4150 SSD became the industry's ﬁrst enterprise SSD
product that is automotive qualiﬁed and is now sampling at target customers, further
reinforcing our commitment to innovation and leadership in this important market.
Now turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2024 DRAM bit demand growth was in
the high teens, consistent with our prior expectations. Calendar 2024 NAND bit
demand growth was approximately 10%, slightly below our previous view of low
double digits. W e forecast calendar 2025 DRAM bit demand growth in the mid- to
high teens percentage range and NAND in the low double-digit percentage range.
Over the medium term, we expect industry bit demand growth of mid-teens CAGR
for both DRAM and NAND.
As we have previously discussed, NAND technology transitions provide a signiﬁcant
increase in overall bit output. Sustained NAND industry supply demand balance can
result from increasing the time between node transitions, along with sustained
reductions in NAND industry CapEx and wafer capacity . NAND industry wafer
capacity underutilization can help to improve the near-term dynamics in the NAND
market.
We expect Micron's supply growth in calendar 2025 to be lower than industry
demand growth for both DRAM and NAND. W e expect our inventory days to decline
as we move through calendar 2025. W e expect to maintain our bit share in DRAM
and NAND in calendar 2025. In DRAM, we expect a strong ramp of HBM throughout
calendar 2025.
As noted before, HBM3E consumes 3x the amount of silicon compared to D5 to
produce the same number of bits. Looking ahead, we expect the trade ratio to
increase with HBM4 and then again with HBM4E when we expect it to exceed 4:1.
The sustained and signiﬁcant increase in silicon intensity for the foreseeable future
contributes to tightness for industry leading-edge node supply and constraints
capacity for non-HBM products.
In NAND, we continue to underutilize our fabs, and our wafer output is down mid-
teens percentage from prior levels. W e plan to reuse a portion of our underutilized
NAND equipment to support capital efﬁcient conversions to leading-edge nodes. This
strategy results in over 10% structural reduction of NAND wafer capacity exiting
ﬁscal 2025 compared to levels exiting ﬁscal 2024.
We will continue to prudently manage our NAND supply , including the levels of our
capital investment, the pace of ramp of our new technology node, SaaS capacity and
utilization, consistent with our demand growth.
Our capital spending plans remain unchanged at approximately $14 billion for ﬁscal
2025. A signiﬁcant portion of our capital investments are focused on multiyear facility
investments to support our DRAM and HBM manufacturing, including our Idaho fab,
Singapore HBM advanced packaging facility and Taiwan DRAM test facility . Micron
will remain disciplined with our overall equipment investments to manage our supply
growth consistent with demand.
On tarif fs, Micron serves as the U.S. importer of record for a very limited volume of
products that would be subject to newly announced tarif fs on Canada, Mexico and
China. W e continue to monitor the possibility of future tarif fs and are prepared to
work with our customers and suppliers to understand future tarif f effects and supply
chain options that may arise. Where tarif fs do have an impact, we intend to pass
those costs along to our customers.
With that, I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thank you, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone.
Micron delivered ﬁscal Q2 EPS above the guidance range and revenue and gross
margin within the range. Total ﬁscal Q2 revenue was approximately $8.1 billion,
down 8% sequentially and up 38% year-over-year . Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was
$6.1 billion, up 47% year-over-year , and represented 76% of total revenue.
Sequentially , DRAM revenue decreased 4%, with bit shipments decreasing in the
high single-digit percentage range and prices increasing in the mid-single-digit
percentage range as a result of improving portfolio mix.
Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was $1.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year and represented
23% of Micron's total revenue. Sequentially , NAND revenue decreased 17%, with bit
shipments modestly higher and prices decreasing in the high-teens percentage
range. Fiscal Q2 bit NAND bit shipments were above our expectations, driven by
higher consumer-oriented shipments.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit
revenue was up 4% sequentially to $4.6 billion and reached 57% of our total
revenue. For the third consecutive quarter , CNBU revenue reached a new quarterly
record, driven by a more than 50% sequential increase in HBM revenue.
Revenue for the Storage business unit was $1.4 billion, down 20% sequentially .
Decline in SBU revenue was driven primarily by lower storage investments from data
center customers after several quarters of very strong growth and overall NAND
industry pricing.
Mobile business unit revenue was $1.1 billion, down 30% sequentially , as mobile
customers continue to improve their inventory positions. Embedded business unit
revenue was $1 billion, down 3% sequentially . Lower sequential revenue was
primarily due to inventory improvement initiatives at automotive customers.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q2 was 37.9%, down 160 basis points
sequentially due primarily to pricing and consumer-oriented segments of the market,
especially in NAND and NAND mix shift to consumer-oriented products, as
mentioned earlier . Our ongoing high-value mix shift in our DRAM portfolio partially
offset some of these factors.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q2 were $1 billion, ﬂat sequentially . R&D expenses
were lower than planned due to earlier product qualiﬁcation and timing of certain
R&D projects. W e generated operating income of $2 billion in ﬁscal Q2, resulting in
an operating margin of 24.9%, which was down approximately 260 basis points
sequentially and up 21 percentage points from the year ago quarter .
Fiscal Q2 adjusted EBITDA  was $4.1 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of
50.7%, up 10 basis points sequentially and up 14 percentage points or $2 billion from
the year ago quarter . Fiscal Q2 taxes were $214 million on an ef fective tax rate of
10.7%, lower than our guidance due to the ef fects of onetime items in the quarter .
Non-GAAP  diluted earnings per share in ﬁscal Q2 was $1.56, above the high end of
the guidance range compared to $1.79 per share in the prior quarter and $0.42 in the
year ago quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. In ﬁscal Q2, our operating cash ﬂows
were over $3.9 billion, and our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion, net of proceeds
from government incentives. As a result, free cash ﬂows in the quarter were $857
million. Our ﬁscal Q2 ending inventory was $9 billion or 158 days, up as
communicated previously , and an increase of 9 days from the prior quarter .
On the balance sheet, we held $9.6 billion of cash and investments at quarter end
and maintained $12.1 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility .
During ﬁscal Q2, we extended our debt maturities through a $1 billion 10-year senior
note of fering and a $1.7 billion term loan, with proceeds principally used to pay down
notes maturing in 2026 and the previous term loan balance.
We ended the quarter with $14.4 billion in total debt, low net leverage and a
weighted average maturity on our debt of 2032. Following quarter end, we renewed
and increased the size of our 5-year revolving credit facility to $3.5 billion. This
provides an additional $1 billion of liquidity and further improves our ﬁnancial
ﬂexibility .
Now turning to our outlook for the third ﬁscal quarter . We forecast growth in DRAM
and NAND bit shipments in ﬁscal Q3. W e forecast sequentially lower ﬁscal Q3 gross
margin, which includes the ef fects of higher consumer-oriented volumes. NAND
underutilization continues to weigh on gross margins.
We project operating expenses in ﬁscal Q3 to be approximately $1.13 billion and
ﬁscal 2025 OpEx to increase by over 10%, reﬂecting planned increases to support
our portfolio of high-value products, including HBM. W e expect DIO to decrease in
the third ﬁscal quarter on higher bit shipments. W e continue to project ending ﬁscal
2025 with tight DRAM inventories.
For ﬁscal Q3 and Q4, we estimate our non-GAAP  tax rate to be approximately 14%.
In ﬁscal Q3, we forecast CapEx to be over $3 billion. Our CapEx projection for ﬁscal
2025 remains approximately $14 billion. The overwhelming majority of the ﬁscal
2025 CapEx is to support HBM, as well as facility construction, back-end
manufacturing and R&D investments. Impacts from potential new tarif fs are not
included in our guidance, given the uncertainty around tarif f timing, nature and
implementation.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q3 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $8.8 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in
the range of 36.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.13 billion, plus or minus $15 million. As mentioned, we expect the
ﬁscal Q3 tax rate to be around 14%. Based on a share count of approximately 1.14
billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.57 per share, plus or minus $0.10.
In ﬁscal Q2, Micron delivered earnings above guidance range, achieved record
revenues again in data center DRAM, ramped our leading HBM and released the
industry's most advanced DRAM process technology . For ﬁscal Q3, we project
record quarterly revenue at the midpoint of our guidance. W e are focusing our R&D
resources, exercising capital discipline and maintaining a strong balance sheet as we
extend our leadership and tap into substantial growth opportunities ahead.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark.
Micron is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the transformative growth driven by AI
from data center to edge devices. And we are on track for the record revenue and
signiﬁcantly improved proﬁtability in ﬁscal 2025. W e are conﬁdent in our ability to
navigate the current market dynamics with disciplined investments and a focus on
our high-value portfolio mix shift.
This is the most exciting time I have seen for memory and storage, and Micron's
innovations are at the forefront of this revolution. W e are excited about the
opportunities ahead and remain committed to delivering value for all our
stakeholders.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
And our ﬁrst question for today comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur
Back in mid-February at an investor conference, I know the team had walked us
through the dynamics on a weaker gross margin proﬁle during the May quarter .
That's playing out, but you did anticipate an improved gross margin proﬁle beyond
this quarter , ﬁscal Q3. So is that still the case that we should see gross margin
improvements maybe starting in ﬁscal Q4 and potentially beyond? And is that a
possible data center and your consumer-related products? Is that across total DRAM
and your NAND segments? Any color here would be great.
Mark Murphy
Sure, Harlan, this is Mark. I'll take that. So let me just make some comments about
the third quarter . It is down sequentially , as we had indicated in the conference. And
again, as we said in the conference down primarily due to higher mix of consumer-
oriented volumes, lower CQ1 pricing on consumer-oriented markets and industry and
can just generally , all that partially of fset by higher HBM. W e do see -- while down,
conditions have improved since those public comments. And the updated view is
reﬂected in the guide today .
Now we're not providing guidance on the fourth quarter . However , we do expect
gross margin to be up somewhat. There's always tailwinds and headwinds. As you
know , on tailwinds, we do expect market conditions to improve. W e do expect HBM
and other high-value products to grow and contribute to mix improvement.
Some headwinds, we do see NAND underutilization as we talked about. And
actually , since our capacity has come down structurally , we're going to see less of
those costs in the third quarter on period and see more of those costs hit us as
inventory clears in the fourth quarter .
It's still -- we've taken actions to manage the NAND supply , and that's important, and
that part of the business is still getting its legs back under it, but we intend to take
price action in the second quarter calendar and just -- to maintain supply discipline.
And then we are going to see in fourth quarter , the beginning of some start-up costs
related to construction activities and new node in DRAM that we're working. So in
short, we would expect fourth quarter margins to be up somewhat from third quarter .
Harlan Sur
I appreciate that. And then, Sanjay , you increased your industry bit demand outlook
from mid-teens last earnings to mid- to high teens this quarter for calendar '25 for
DRAM. I assume part of it is the HBM related dynamics as you increased your TAM
outlook for HBM this year . But is the team seeing any other segments within DRAM
that are driving the better industry , this demand proﬁle as the year unfolds?
Sanjay Mehrotra
We had projected that customer inventories will get in a better place by spring time
frame in the consumer side of the business. And it's turning out to be the way we had
projected. And of course, the smartphone and PC markets are also seeing more and
more devices that have AI implemented. That drives content growth. So as customer
inventories got closer to healthier levels, we are seeing resumption of purchases by
customers, and all that plays into our guide for 2025 bit demand.
And as you noted, of course, data center continues to be strong. And in data center ,
of course, HBM is a strong contributor towards revenue growth in terms of bit
demand growth for data center , of course, high-density DIMMs, as well as LP  where
Micron leads the industry , all of these actually contributing towards the demand
increase in 2025 as well.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
Mark, can you give us a little detail on the ﬁscal Q3 guidance? You're guiding
revenue up about $750 million. How much of that is coming from DRAM versus
NAND? And I know you said that bits are up in both. But can you give us a sense of
how much bits are up in each of those 2 markets? And then I had another question
as well.
Mark Murphy
Yes. Tim, we've provided you the consolidated revenue number . You have the year-
to-date ﬁgures on both revenue and DRAM, our revenue and bit growth and price for
both DRAM and NAND. And then we've provided you a demand growth for the year
in bits. So I think we've provided you the contours of the business, and you should be
able to make some volume and price assumptions on the revenue outlook. W e do
expect bit growth in both DRAM and NAND in third quarter .
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . But I guess, Mark, can you say that you expect revenue growth in both DRAM
and NAND as well?
Mark Murphy
DRAM with the HBM and data center exposure will be -- the bias of growth will be
there.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . Cool. And then -- so Mark, I mean, obviously , everything you're doing here is
great. I think the -- bugaboo obviously is -- margins are still a bit low , certainly into
the ﬁscal Q4. So I guess I had like a 2-part question. One, I know you don't want to
guide ﬁscal Q4 margins, but do you think you can get back to what you just did in
ﬁscal Q2 in ﬁscal Q4?
And I guess, broadly , when does this stuf f clear and sort of we begin to see the true
goodness ﬂowing through from HBM and from all the cost downs you're doing on the
non-HBM DRAM side? So sort of when do we start to get kind of a clean gross
margin number , if you will?
Mark Murphy
Tim, we're not going to provide a fourth quarter number . We have indicated that
fourth quarter gross margins would be up somewhat from third quarter . I think as
Sanjay mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're in the best position we've ever
been in on technology and market exposure products. Manufacturing is operating
very well.
On the cost side, maybe to help you with the modeling, our all in DRAM costs for
ﬁscal year '25, we expect to be ﬂattish. Our all-in NAND cost for FY  '25, in line with
front-end cost reductions in the low double-digits. So we are taking supply actions on
the NAND side, consists of underloading, reducing CapEx, delaying node transitions,
as we talked about. And we're beginning to see some signs of improvement on that
part of the business.
On the DRAM side of the business, we know the continued HBM growth and broader
data center . And then the lead edge on DRAM is tight, and we're, again, projecting
our DIO levels to be below our target by the end of the ﬁscal year .
Sanjay Mehrotra
And Tim, I'll just add that, of course, we continue to be focused on increasing the mix
of our revenue towards higher proﬁt pools of the industry , both in DRAM and NAND.
So in terms of our product portfolio, as we have said, it is best positioned. So
continue to drive the product portfolio and mix, focusing on, really strengthened
proﬁtability . And demand trends we have talked about, I mean we feel good about
DRAM demand trend.
And of course, in NAND, the supply discipline will be important. W e, of course, are
extremely focused on that. And AI is beneﬁting our DRAM demand across data
center and edge as well. And of course, our technology position, our product position
and our cost position continues to be healthy .
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar
I have 2 of them, ﬁrst, Sanjay or Mark. You've seen some of the memory prices
improve of late. I'm just wondering how much of that is true end demand versus
actually tarif f-related pull-ins? And how sustainable do you think the industry pricing
dynamics today are?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So of course, as we have indicated, the DRAM demand drivers as well as NAND on
the consumer side of the business in smartphones, particularly in smartphones as
well as in PCs are improving as the customers are getting closer to their normal
inventory levels in the consumer market again, along the lines of what we had
projected.
PC, probably more second half of this year that we start seeing greater demand
trend with respect to AI PCs and increasing penetration of AI PCs. AI PCs require
greater DRAM content than what was in the past, we have talked about that last
year, average 12 gigabyte in PCs and AI PCs with the NPU running at 40 tops or
higher requires 16 gigabytes or higher .
So these are good demand trends on the PC side and same thing happening on the
smartphone side. You have seen several introductions and more of these are
smartphones and more of them to be rolling out with AI smartphones that too have
higher DRAM content greater than 12 gigabyte versus last year at 8 gigabyte. And of
course, data center demand trend in DRAM continues to be strong as well.
So all of this, I mean, ﬁrst of all, demand trends are in a good place. And of course,
on the supply side, leading-edge supply , as we mentioned in the prepared remarks,
as well as Mark just mentioned, leading-edge DRAM supply is tight. And certainly ,
that is happening because of increasing demand for the HBM and HBM trade ratio.
And on NAND, the supply actions by various players and underutilization in the fabs
certainly is improving the supply picture as well.
So all of this is improving the demand/supply environment in the industry . And of
course, we are well focused on driving an inﬂection towards higher pricing in CQ2
and we are well positioned with our products across the end market segments. And
we really look forward to continue to maximize the opportunities for our business and
continue to increase the mix of our business toward higher proﬁt pools of the
industry .
Krish Sankar
Got it. Got it. Thanks, Sanjay . And then a quick question on the gross margin side.
Clearly , HBM3E 8-high is obviously a mature technology as you move to 12-high in
HBM4. W ould the yields might be lower than 8-high? Just kind of curious, does it
have any negative impact on gross margins? Or is it de minimis at this point?
Sanjay Mehrotra
First of all, in HBM3E 8-high, I'm very pleased with how our team has executed. And
we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we actually delivered greater volume of
HBM3E versus our plans in our FQ2 and exceeded revenue for the ﬁrst time, a major
milestone of more than $1 billion. And HBM3E continues to do well with 8-high, our
yields, our capacity ramp is going well. Our execution is going well.
And all that experience of 8-high in terms of capacity ramp as well as yield ramp will,
of course, help us as we ramp our 12-high. You know , we have announced before
that we are now in volume production with our 12-high. Just like any other new
product, and these are highly complex products, HBM is the most complex product
ever made in the industry . These kind of complex products, of course, in the early
stages, there is a yield ramp.
We expect 12-high to, of course, have a premium over 8-high and of course, will
continue to be accretive to our DRAM margins nicely as well. And we remain very
focused in second half shifting the vast majority of the second half of the calendar
year, shifting the vast majority of our volume to 12-high. And as we ramp that
volume, of course, yields will continue to go up as well. And with that, by the end of
this calendar year , as we shared with you, we expect to reach our share to be in line
with our overall industry DRAM share.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley .
Joseph Moore
Great. I wanted to make sure I got the inventory targets right. So you're at 153 days
and you'll be below the target model, which I think is 120 days in 2 quarters. And I
guess if that's right that seems like a lot of reduction. Can you talk about how much
volume do you need to do that? How much is the inventory kind of impacted by some
of the HBM supply trends, things like that? Could you just characterize a little bit,
how you reduce that much inventory?
Mark Murphy
Yes, Joe, it's Mark. So 158 days. I think it was the DIO in the second quarter . As
we've talked about, conditions are tighter in DRAM than NAND. You've heard about
the supply actions that we've taken on NAND. W e have seen good volume growth
there, and that is expected to continue. But the industry conditions are such that
you've heard us talk about underutilization, reducing CapEx and delaying the node
transition.
On the DRAM side, as Sanjay mentioned, AI-driven growth and related to HBM and
other product sets, but particularly HBM with the trade ratio is creating tightness in
that market. And the target we have for inventories that we've stated before is 120
days, and we would expect to be below that on DRAM by -- in our ﬁscal fourth
quarter .
Joseph Moore
Okay . Great. And did you guide inventory for this coming quarter with -- I assume that
starts to come down now?
Mark Murphy
We just said that on days, that will go down through the year .
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.
CJ Muse
I guess ﬁrst question, I to follow up on gross margins, Mark, is there a point where
we're thinking about the underutilization charges and the period cost into kind of May
and August on the NAND side? And then is there also a way to think about the
incremental construction cost as we go into August and November?
Mark Murphy
Yes. So CJ, the -- we had less period costs in our third quarter here than we had
originally projected in part due to the fact that we've structurally brought down our
capacity . And so more of the underutilization charge will go into inventories, and then
that will ﬂush through that way versus a period cost. Those period costs, I'd say the
under-absorption costs do weigh on gross margins in fourth quarter and into '26.
Now even with that, the combination of growth in the business, the improved market
conditions and the mix improvements, those will, we believe, result in somewhat
higher gross margins in the fourth quarter . As it relates to start-up costs, the ef fect is
relatively small on a sequential basis, third to fourth quarter . But as we approach
wafer outs in Idaho, that number will increase through '26. And so we'll provide more
color on that as our plans and timing is ﬁnalized.
CJ Muse
Very helpful. And a quick follow-up. You revised your HBM industry revenue outlook
higher . Curious if there's a framework on how you're thinking about kind of ﬁrst half
versus second half for the industry?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Of course, the revenue in the second half as you go from 8-high to 12-high continues
to go up because 12-high will be carrying a certain premium over 8-high. So if we
have projected more than $35 billion for calendar year 2025 and a bigger portion of
that in second half of calendar '25 versus ﬁrst half. And more than $35 billion, of
course, is the industry TAM for HBM that we have referred to here.
And I'll just point out that, of course, with respect to HBM, there is expansion of HBM
customer base taking place. Micron itself, now we are shipping to a third large
customer that we have begun shipping our products to. So that also is contributing to
the growth in HBM revenue in the second half as the customer base expands.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from W olfe Research.
Chris Caso
Yes. First question is with regard to the lower end of the market. And -- if you could
tell us about what the exposure is, particularly on DRAM side, LP4 and DDR4. And I
guess as you start to see growth in HBM, get some normalization in some of the
consumer markets as you go to the second half of the year , I guess, is that going to
be kind of -- have a de minimis ef fect on revenue and margins as you go into the
second half?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So regarding D4 and LP4, last quarter in our earnings call, we had shared that our
revenue from those products, LP4 and D4, for the remainder of the ﬁscal year , we
have said at the time, corresponds to about 10% of our total company revenue. So
we continue to see that for the remainder of the ﬁscal year . And your second
question is that -- can you repeat the second question?
Chris Caso
Yes. It's just -- does that have a de minimis ef fect on margins? I guess the point is,
does that cease being a drag on margins as you go into the second half as other
parts of the business grow?
Sanjay Mehrotra
I mean it is a smaller part of the overall company revenue. And it is -- I mean, we are,
of course, leading in D5 and HBM. And D5 based and LP5-based product in data
center as well as other parts of the consumer markets. So of course, LP4 and D4 will
continue to become smaller over time. And just keep in mind that, overall, industry
conditions in DRAM are improving from the point of view of DRAM demand drivers
and the supply tightness. And that can also play some role in the overall dynamics of
all parts of the DRAM market.
Chris Caso
As a follow-up on HBM, what you said in the past is you sold out for the year . But yet,
your TAM assumptions have moved higher for the past several quarters. As we look
into next year , presumably , the higher TAM this year translates to higher TAM
assumptions as you go to next year . Are -- do you still have the capability to increase
your capacity to maintain that market share in HBM, which is equal to our overall
share of DRAM as you go into next year?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So of course, we have said that as we exit calendar '25, our share in HBM will
correspond to our industry DRAM shares. So if you look at that run rate, I mean,
clearly , in calendar year 2026, our share would be higher for the full year basis
versus 2025. And we remain very focused on continuing to increase our capacity of
HBM.
I mentioned earlier that we are doing executing quite well in terms of continuing to
increase the capacity , continuing to shift from 8-high to 12-high, very much focused
on bringing HBM4 into the market next year and, of course, addressing all the
capacity needs related to that as well.
So while we are not projecting 2026 market share at this time, we feel very good
about our HBM position, our close relationships with our customers, our execution on
our technology and products and our manufacturing overall.
Operator
And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi.
Chris Danely
Thanks. So if we look at the May guidance and then just going back the last 3
quarters, your revenue is between $7.8 billion and $8.8 billion per year . And the last
time that happened was about 3 years ago, that was the last upturn but your gross
margins were 10 points higher . So why are gross margins -- because depreciation
hasn't changed that much? Why are gross margins like 10 points lower at essentially
the same revenue base? And does this mean that we can forget about your gross
margins ever going to the 50s again? Or maybe give us a path to getting them back
there, if you think that that's conceivable?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Overall, our gross margins in DRAM have been healthy and again, supported by our
strong technology and product positions based on our D5 products, LP5 products,
HBM products. NAND is what has weighed down on our margins. And of course, we
have continued to focus. And NAND, it is because of the overall industry environment
and overall industry demand/supply imbalances.
And so of course, both in DRAM and NAND, it's always a function of demand/supply
environment but also very much a focus of ours on increasing the mix of the
business towards high-value solutions. And that's what we continue to do in NAND
as well. And as we see a greater supply discipline, we would certainly fully expect
that NAND fundamentals would improve in the industry as well. Of course, it's
important to maintain the focus on sustained supply discipline there as well.
So as we look ahead, we -- as we have pointed out, that we remain very focused on
continuing to strengthen the mix of our revenue, mix of our products in the business
towards higher-margin products, both in NAND and DRAM, continue to focus on
product portfolio strength, managing demand supply very closely and managing our
technology development and ramp into production closely to make sure that our
supply and demand is well aligned and of course, very much focused on overall
costs as well.
And with that, we are certainly optimistic here that the structural overall with the
industry that the improvements will occur in the business fundamentals.
Chris Danely
Thanks, Sanjay . Just 1 brief follow-up on that. So you talked about increasing the mix
to higher-value solutions. And then in the commentary and also in the press release,
you said that part of the reason that the gross margin was lower was this increasing
consumer exposure. And your NAND actually was down a lot more than DRAM. So
are you seeing increased consumer exposure in DRAM? And why is that happening?
And how do we -- or how do you guys change that?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, ﬁrst of all, we are doing well in data center and our mix of business in data
center for DRAM, as we have pointed out, continues to increase. And we have
leadership products in DRAM with data centers, including, not just HBM, but we have
also talked about when we just announced -- SOCAMM products, these are
important products. So doing well with respect to DRAM.
On the consumer side, of course, over the last few quarters, there was overhang of
customer inventory on the consumer side, and that was there in DRAM as well. And
as that customer inventories get closer to normalization along the lines of what we
have said before, of course, along with the AI drivers in consumer devices, we see a
strong bounce back particularly in smartphones with respect to demand.
And that's causing actually overall HBM trade ratio as well as a strong bounce back
in the consumer demand is causing tightness in leading edge as well. And of course,
these fundamentals of demand and supply enable us to drive inﬂection in pricing
higher in CQ2 timeframe.
And same thing on the NAND side that supply actions that have been taken in the
industry as well as consumer inventories -- on the -- customer consumer inventory is
getting normalized, is bringing back demand on the NAND side as well. And of
course, we'll be driving inﬂection in pricing higher on the NAND side as well in CQ2.
Operator
