Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone.
Micron delivered record quarterly revenue with strong proﬁtability and free cash ﬂow ,
enabled by our team’ s excellent execution and our industry-leading technology and
product portfolio. Micron achieved revenue records in the auto, industrial and
networking markets, and in SSDs for both data center and client. Our NAND
business delivered record quarterly revenue, and our Embedded Business Unit and
Storage Business Unit NAND revenues also hit all-time highs. Our 1-alpha DRAM
and 176-layer NAND ramps are several quarters ahead of the industry and
progressing well as we continue to qualify new products that use these nodes. The
Micron team delivered these excellent results despite supply chain challenges and
COVID-19 control measures in China, which impacted our business on both the
demand side and the supply side.
There are consumer demand and inventory-related headwinds impacting the industry
and consequently our ﬁscal Q4 outlook. However , we remain conﬁdent about the
secular demand for memory and storage, the attractiveness of our market
opportunity , Micron’ s excellent competitive position and strong execution capabilities,
and our cross-cycle ﬁnancial model.
Micron is leading the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology , and we are also
well-poised to continue this lead into calendar 2023.
In DRAM, our 1-alpha node ramp is several quarters ahead of the industry , and in
ﬁscal Q3, 1-alpha represented the largest DRAM node in our shipment mix. Our
newest node, 1-beta, is on track to ramp in manufacturing by the end of calendar
2022.
In NAND, our industry-leading 176-layer node continues to grow in mix of sales,
having previously reached the majority of our NAND bit shipments in ﬁscal Q2. This
technology node is contributing to a competitive cost structure across our product
portfolio, and in FQ3, we achieved several important 176-layer product qualiﬁcations.
We are also making excellent progress on our 232-layer node and expect to ramp
production by the end of calendar 2022.
Across the industry , there are cost challenges stemming from supply chain and
inﬂationary pressures; however , we continue to expect our cost reductions to
outpace those of the industry this year , driven by excellent productivity improvements
in our fabs and the well-executed ramp of our world-class 1-alpha DRAM and 176-
layer NAND nodes.
Despite COVID-19 control measures in China that created challenges for the global
electronics supply chain, Micron’ s strong execution enabled record assembly output
in ﬁscal Q3, supporting record quarterly revenue. However , these COVID-19 control
measures in China impacted our outsourced assembly and test subcontractors and
led to some impact to ﬁscal Q3 results.
Now turning to our end markets. AI, ongoing cloud adoption, EVs and the ubiquitous
connectivity of fered by 5G are strong secular demand drivers, enabling the memory
and storage industry to outpace the broader semiconductor industry . Micron’ s
product portfolio has become signiﬁcantly stronger , and we have established product
momentum in several attractive growth markets. W e are also driving a portfolio mix
shift toward higher growth and more stable markets. Fiscal 2021’ s 55 to 45 revenue
split in favor of the more mature mobile, PC and consumer markets is expected to
shift, by ﬁscal 2025, to a 38 to 62 split in favor of the higher growth data center , auto,
industrial, networking and graphics markets. Several of these end markets also
exhibit more stable proﬁtability . Our ﬁscal Q3 new product launches and customer
qualiﬁcations reﬂect solid execution toward this portfolio transformation.
Data center is the largest market for memory and storage today , and the rapid growth
of AI and memory-intensive workloads ensures that it will sustain strong growth
through the end of the decade.
Corporations around the world are investing in digitization and extracting more value
from data, and this approach remains one of the primary ways of improving efﬁciency
and driving competitive advantage.
Data center ﬁscal Q3 revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially and
well over 50% year-over-year . Data center end demand is expected to remain strong
in the second half of calendar 2022, driven by robust cloud CapEx growth. Despite
the strong end demand, we are seeing some enterprise OEM customers wanting to
pare back their memory and storage inventory due to non-memory component
shortages and macroeconomic concerns.
In ﬁscal Q3, we achieved several product and customer milestones. W e began
volume shipments of HBM2E, one of the fastest-growing product categories, driven
by the growth in AI and machine-learning workloads. Micron continues to lead in
DDR5; however , delays in the rollout of new server CPU platforms have slowed the
industry DDR5 ramp versus prior expectations. In data center SSDs, we more than
doubled revenue year-over-year and achieved a new revenue record in the ﬁscal
third quarter . We are excited by the strong reception of our industry-leading 176-layer
data center NVMe SSDs, which are already in volume production, and in ﬁscal Q3,
we completed qualiﬁcations with three OEMs. W e recently launched the world’ s ﬁrst
176-layer data center SA TA SSD, which will help sustain our industry leadership in
this product category .
In ﬁscal Q3, we achieved client revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage range
sequentially , driven by DRAM shipments and share gains in client SSD.
A number of factors have impacted consumer PC demand in various geographies.
As a consequence, our forecast for calendar 2022 PC unit sales is now expected to
decline by nearly 10% year-over-year from the very strong unit sales in calendar
2021. This compares to an industry and customer forecast of roughly ﬂat calendar
2022 PC unit sales at the start of this calendar year .
We expect PC per unit memory and storage content growth trends to remain healthy
in calendar 2022, driven by a mix shift toward enterprise PCs and the increasing
content in new architectures such as Apple’ s M1 Ultra platform, which features up to
128 gigabyte of DRAM.
Micron has a strong product portfolio and is well-positioned in this market. W e are
leading the DDR5 transition and expect our DDR5 revenue to continue to grow as
multiple client customers launch next-generation notebooks. Increased availability of
non-memory bill of materials will also improve our ability to ship DDR5-based
modules. In addition, we continue to lead the industry in client QLC SSD technology
and expect QLC to increase as a percentage of 176-layer bit output in ﬁscal Q4 and
beyond.
In ﬁscal Q3, graphics revenue grew at a strong double-digit percentage rate
sequentially and year-over-year , driven by the strength of Micron’ s products and
customer relationships. Micron continues to be the industry performance leader in
graphics. W e announced volume shipments of our new 1z 16 gigabit GDDR6X in
ﬁscal Q3, which features twice the capacity and up to 15% higher performance than
the previous 1y generation. The 24 gigabit per second peak bandwidth of GDDR6X
is made possible by Micron’ s groundbreaking P AM4 signal transmission technology .
No other memory vendor of fers this capability or level of performance.
We also began volume shipments of our newest 1z 16 gigabit GDDR6 product to our
largest graphics customers.
Fiscal Q3 mobile revenue declined slightly year-over-year but grew quarter-over-
quarter due to strong customer partnerships and product execution.
Smartphone unit sales expectations have declined meaningfully for calendar 2022.
We are now projecting smartphone unit volume to decline by mid-single-digits
percent range year-over-year in calendar 2022, well below the industry and customer
expectation earlier in the year of mid-single-digit percentage growth. 5G unit sales
are expected to grow and reach approximately 50% penetration of the smartphone
unit TAM this year .
The growth of 5G units will also drive higher DRAM and NAND content. W e continue
to deliver key mobile customer qualiﬁcations and strong mobile product ramps on our
leading nodes. In ﬁscal Q3, we expanded our 1-alpha LPDRAM leadership with the
industry’ s ﬁrst ramp of 1-alpha LPDDR5. In addition, 176-layer NAND made up over
90% of our mobile NAND bit shipments.
Micron is the market share and quality leader in the fast-growing auto and industrial
end markets, and in ﬁscal Q3, we achieved record revenue in both. These markets
also exhibit higher stability in their gross margin proﬁle through the cycle. Auto
growth has been driven by robust demand that remains constrained by auto unit
production. W e see robust auto content growth as OEMs adopt signiﬁcant
architectural changes to support ADAS, infotainment and electric vehicles. In ﬁscal
Q3, there were announcements of several new EVs featuring content-rich ADAS,
including the Ford F-150 Lightning, Mercedes EQS SUV and EQE sedan, and BMW
iX1. W e expect the auto market to have a strong long-term bit growth CAGR in
DRAM and NAND that is roughly twice the CAGR of the overall DRAM and NAND
markets, and consequently our strength in this market will become increasingly
important.
Industrial IoT  achieved record revenue in ﬁscal Q3, demonstrating broad-based
growth with various end market applications. W e continue to see tailwinds from
secular growth drivers as industrial customers invest in increasing factory automation
and digitization.
Turning to the market outlook.
Our expectations for calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth have moderated
since our last earnings call. Near the end of ﬁscal Q3, we saw a signiﬁcant reduction
in near-term industry bit demand, primarily attributable to end demand weakness in
consumer markets, including PC and smartphone. These consumer markets have
been impacted by the weakness in consumer spending in China, the Russia-Ukraine
war, and rising inﬂation around the world.
COVID-19 control measures in China have exacerbated supply chain challenges for
some customers, and the macroeconomic environment is also creating some caution
amongst certain customers. Several customers, primarily in PC and smartphone, are
adjusting their inventories, and we expect these adjustments to take place mostly in
the second half of calendar 2022.
While end demand in the mobile, PC and consumer markets has weakened, cloud,
networking, automotive and industrial markets are showing resilience.
Due to weaker demand in the second half of calendar 2022, we now expect year-
over-year calendar 2022 industry bit demand growth to be below the long-term
CAGRs of mid-to-high-teens percentage for DRAM and high-20s percentage for
NAND. Despite the near-term weakness, secular demand trends remain strong, and
our view of long-term DRAM and NAND bit demand CAGR remains unchanged from
prior expectations.
Turning to supply . Given the change in market conditions, we are taking immediate
action to reduce our supply growth trajectory . To protect proﬁtability , we will maintain
pricing discipline, manage capacity utilization, and use inventory as a buf fer to
navigate through this period of demand weakness. Additionally , we are planning for a
reduced level of bit supply growth in ﬁscal 2023 and will use inventory to supply part
of the market demand next year . This approach will enable us to reduce wafer fab
equipment CapEx for ﬁscal year 2023 versus our prior plans, and we now expect our
ﬁscal 2023 wafer fab equipment CapEx to decline year-over-year .
Overall industry supply is also being impacted. Manufacturing equipment shipment
delays, challenges for some in the industry in ramping new nodes of technology and
DRAM supply discipline evident in the industry are all expected to limit supply growth
over the next few quarters. These supply reductions will help of fset some impact of
the weaker demand.
I will now turn it over to Mark Murphy , Micron’ s Chief Financial Ofﬁcer .
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay .
Micron delivered strong results in ﬁscal Q3, marked by record quarterly revenue and
$1.3 billion of free cash ﬂow .
Total ﬁscal Q3 revenue was $8.6 billion, up 1 1% sequentially and up 16% year-over-
year. Growth was strong across most end markets.
Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $6.3 billion, representing 73% of total revenue. DRAM
revenue increased 10% sequentially and was up 15% year-over-year . Sequentially ,
bit shipments increased by slightly over 10% while ASPs declined slightly .
Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $2.3 billion, representing 26% of Micron’ s total
revenue. NAND revenue increased 17% sequentially and was up 26% year-over-
year. Sequential bit shipments increased in the high-teens percent, and ASPs
declined slightly .
Now turning to our ﬁscal Q3 revenue trends by business unit.
Revenue for the Compute and Networking Business Unit was $3.9 billion, up 13%
sequentially and up 18% year-over-year . Data center , graphics and networking
contributed to both year-over-year and sequential growth.
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was approximately $2 billion, up 5%
sequentially and down 2% year-over-year . Strong execution and product momentum
allowed MBU to deliver sequential growth in a challenging smartphone market
demand environment.
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.3 billion, up 15% sequentially and up
33% year-over-year .
We achieved record SSD revenue, with both data center and client SSD revenues
reaching all-time highs. Data center SSD revenue more than doubled year-over-year .
Finally , we achieved record revenue for the Embedded Business Unit at $1.4 billion,
up 12% sequentially and up 30% year-over-year . Both automotive and industrial
revenues set records in the quarter .
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q3 was 47.4%, down approximately 40
basis points sequentially . An increasing mix of NAND contributed to the decline.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q3 were approximately $950 million, below the low end
of the guidance range and down approximately $20 million sequentially . OpEx
beneﬁted from the timing of our technology and product qualiﬁcations and from lower
variable compensation. Although we are taking actions to reduce OpEx in light of
current market conditions, we expect OpEx to increase sequentially due to the timing
of technology and product qualiﬁcations.
Fiscal Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of
36.4%, up approximately 1 10 basis points sequentially and up 450 basis points from
the prior year . Fiscal Q3 adjusted EBITDA  was approximately $5 billion, resulting in
an EBITDA  margin of 57.4%, down approximately 40 basis points sequentially and
up over 400 basis points versus the prior year .
Non-GAAP  earnings per share EPS in ﬁscal Q3 were $2.59, up from $2.14 in ﬁscal
Q2 and up from $1.88 in the year-ago quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. W e generated $3.8 billion in cash from
operations in ﬁscal Q3, representing 44% of revenue.
Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion during the quarter . We expect ﬁscal 2022
CapEx to be approximately $12 billion. Our free cash ﬂow for ﬁscal Q3 was $1.3
billion.
During the quarter , we completed share repurchases of $981 million or
approximately 13.8 million shares.
Including our dividend payment, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders in ﬁscal Q3.
Since the share repurchase program’ s inception in ﬁscal 2019 through the end of
ﬁscal Q3, we have deployed $5.7 billion toward repurchasing 108 million shares at
an average price of approximately $53 per share. As we discussed at Investor Day ,
we are committed to returning to shareholders all of the free cash ﬂow generated
over the cycle through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Share
repurchases will be both programmatic and opportunistic, and we expect to purchase
more as the stock trades at bigger discounts to intrinsic value.
On dividends, our Board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.1 15 per
share, a 15% increase over the prior dividend, to be paid on July 26th to
shareholders of record on July 1 1th.
Our ending ﬁscal Q3 inventory was $5.6 billion, and average days of inventory for the
quarter were down to 109 days from 1 13 days last quarter .
We ended the quarter with $12 billion of cash and investments and $14.5 billion of
total liquidity . Our ﬁscal Q3 total debt was $7 billion.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal fourth quarter . Long-term demand trends
remain constructive; however , select market weakness and macroeconomic
uncertainty are impacting our near-term outlook and visibility . Currently , we do project
sequential bit shipments to be down for both DRAM and NAND in ﬁscal Q4. W e
intend to maintain pricing discipline and walk away from business which doesn’t
meet our pricing objectives. While we are taking proactive steps to control OpEx and
CapEx, we expect the impact of these actions to be limited in ﬁscal Q4 and to
become more material in ﬁscal year ‘23.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for the ﬁscal Q4 is as follows.
We expect revenue to be $7.2 billion, plus or minus $400 million; gross margin to be
in the range of 42.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.05 billion, plus or minus $25 million. W e expect our non-GAAP  tax
rate to be approximately 9% for ﬁscal Q4. Based on a share count of approximately
1.13 billion fully diluted shares, we expect EPS to be $1.63, plus or minus $0.20. W e
remain on track to deliver record revenue and solid proﬁtability and free cash ﬂow in
ﬁscal year 2022.
In closing, we delivered strong results in our ﬁscal Q3, but near-term headwinds are
impacting our ﬁscal Q4 outlook. Beyond the near term, we project secular growth
drivers such as data center , automotive and other areas to support robust DRAM and
NAND growth and strong cross-cycle ﬁnancial performance by Micron. At our
Investor Day event last month, we laid out a cross-cycle ﬁnancial model for the
Company that reﬂects the key attributes of our business: a strong revenue growth
CAGR of high single digits, robust cross-cycle operating margins of approximately
30%, and healthy free cash ﬂow margins that exceed 10% of revenues. Given our
long-term ﬁnancial outlook and the strength of our balance sheet, we see the current
share price as very attractive and, at these levels, intend to repurchase shares more
aggressively in ﬁscal Q4.
I will now turn it back to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark.
The memory and storage TAM is expected to grow to $330 billion by 2030 and
become an increasing portion of the semiconductor market. The near-term market
environment notwithstanding, we are executing extremely well on all aspects of the
business that are within our control. Micron’ s continuing technology , product and
manufacturing leadership puts us in an excellent position to capitalize on the long-
term opportunity and to extend the frontiers of what is possible with memory and
storage. W e will continue to exercise supply discipline and take appropriate actions
to navigate through the near-term headwinds, and we remain focused on creating
value for shareholders and generating healthy free cash ﬂow cross cycle.
Thanks for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JP
Morgan.
Harlan Sur
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the data center business, as you
guys mentioned, I mean, enterprise CIOs are concerned on the macro outlook and
pulling back on their spending budgets. Cloud remains strong. But within that, we’ve
heard that continue -- there’ s continued strength from the U.S. cloud service
providers, but a pullback in spending from the China cloud customers. Are you guys
seeing these dynamics within your cloud segment? And then, on the supply side,
again, within your cloud business, can you discuss the level of inventories in the
channel and at customers that feed into the cloud segment? Because we’re hearing
that kind of similar to enterprise that inventories in the cloud channels are also pretty
elevated, but wanted to get your views.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And before I answer the question, I just wanted to
note here that we have Sumit Sadana, our Executive V ice President and Chief
Business Ofﬁcer here as well. As you may recall, Sumit was with us in the last
earnings call. And in the given environment, I thought it would be good to have him
here to add any color to the market environment related speciﬁc questions.
So, with respect to the question you asked regarding the enterprise server OEM side
of the business. There, yes, as we noted that we have seen some inventory
adjustment, particularly given their concerns on the macro environment as well as
certain supply chain shortages that they may be experiencing. However , on the
enterprise server OEM side, the end market demand continues to be healthy as well.
And same thing on the cloud side as well that the end market demand for cloud is
healthy , cloud demand to us is relatively healthy as well. Of course, cloud also
carries elevated levels of inventory versus the pre-COVID level of investments
versus the pre-COVID level of inventory . And of course, the cloud investments in
CapEx continued to be at a strong clip in their infrastructure, and that bodes well for
memory and storage.
And I think what’ s important is that the overall trend of digitization and use of data to
help drive greater productivity and efﬁciency in businesses, particularly in the
backdrop that the world is facing today with the macroeconomic uncertainties is
helpful in driving greater technology adoption across industries, and that’ s where
memory and storage plays out well as well.
And speciﬁcally , with respect to China and U.S., of course, in China, as we have
pointed out earlier , we have seen overall weakness and certainly weakness on the
consumer demand side from China as well as some other parts of the world. But we
are not really breaking it down between China and U.S. at this point. But again, the
overall cloud trends continue to be healthy in terms of the end demand.
Sumit, do you want to add any comment on channel customers in terms of
inventory?
Sumit Sadana
Yes. I mean, I think the inventory level, as Sanjay said, is higher on the cloud
customer side and generally on the data center side compared to where it was pre-
COVID. The channel business on the cloud side is relatively in a better place
compared to the consumer business challenges that Sanjay highlighted. But of
course, dif ferent customers have dif ferent strategies on how they manage their
particular inventory . And the smaller customers in the channel that focus on data
center products have had more challenges getting their hands on some of these
products that are in shortage like NIC cards to complete server builds, and the
smaller customers are getting more impacted there than some of the bigger
customers.
Sanjay Mehrotra
And Harlan, I’ll tell you that we work very closely with our customers. I mean our
team here, Sumit, myself, I mean, we really engage very closely with our customers
across our ecosystem partners here - in China as well as here in the U.S. and
worldwide. So, of course, we are keeping close tabs on how the business
environment is evolving.
Operator
Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.
C.J. Muse
I guess, ﬁrst question, can you speak to the magnitude of the correction for both
DRAM and NAND, how you see that playing out? I’m assuming here that it’ s a much
larger impact on the DRAM side for you and should be thinking maybe bits down
kind of in the low teens. Is that the right way to think about it?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So certainly , on the -- in terms of inventory adjustments that are primarily happening
in the smartphone and the PC market. Of course, those inventory adjustments are
happening in NAND as well as in DRAM. And clearly , as we have said that in terms
of overall demand projection for this year , we deﬁnitely see it below -- for DRAM
below the guidance we had provided earlier as well as the longer term CAGR for
DRAMs mid-teens to high teens. So, we see that below that trajectory . And in terms
of NAND, same thing that earlier we had said that the CAGR is high 20s, and we see
that in calendar year ‘22 coming in below that. Again, adjustments are happening
with respect to inventory both in smartphone and PC market.
And just keep in mind that compared to earlier in the year estimation for PC growth,
we now are projecting that PC year-over-year in calendar year ‘22 will be down
nearly 10%. Similarly , smartphone at the start of the year was expected to grow in
mid-single digits in terms of total unit sales worldwide year-over-year and now , one is
looking at a decline of mid-single digits. So, a swing of 10% in smartphones as well.
If you were to translate it into units, it amounts to like 130 million units reduction
versus expectation earlier in the year for smartphone. And similarly for PC, let’ s say ,
30 million kind of reduction in terms of total units versus the projections earlier in the
year. And of course, PC and smartphone combined represent half of the memory and
storage worldwide demand in terms of bits, right? So, with this adjustment primarily
happening in the second half of this year in these two markets, clearly that is
resulting in a year-over-year change versus prior expectations in DRAM as well as
NAND demand growth.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful. As a follow-up, Mark, you talked about WFE trending lower in ﬁscal ‘23.
Can you give an idea of the magnitude there? And then, how should we think about
overall CapEx trending into ﬁscal ‘23?
Mark Murphy
Yes. C.J., as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to end ﬁscal ‘22 at
around $12 billion, so -- on total CapEx. So that would be an uptick in Q4. And that’ s
consistent with previous statements.
Now, with bit supply growth assumptions coming of f versus previous group -- the
view, we’re actively working to bring spend down. And as you say , we’re conﬁdent
that as we sit here today , WFE spend will be down in ﬁscal ‘23. W e’re also evaluating
construction and other large areas of spend. W e’re looking to reduce utilization on
some older nodes to maintain supply and drive CapEx for use and shift production to
more cost-ef fective nodes, doing a number of things. And the market is dynamic. So,
this is real time. I’m not going to size the reduction next year just at this point
because it’ s still moving. But at this point, we’re conﬁdent that WFE will decline year-
over-year .
Operator
Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company .
Krish Sankar
I have two quick ones. First one, Sanjay or Sumit, I kind of have dif ferent way of
asking the cloud question. As you mentioned, mobile and PC are slow , but it seems
like data center the next year to drop, but yet, you seem optimistic about data center
to remain strong in the second half 2022, but you also said cloud inventory is high.
So, it seems like if consumer spending slows, which it is, data center CapEx is a drift.
So, love to hear your thoughts why you think overall, the U.S. cloud trends, one, drop
in the second half of this year?
And then a quick follow-up question for maybe Mark was on the impact of the China
Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown. Is there a way to quantify what it was in the May
quarter and what it means to second half output for Micron?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So earlier , I provided some color regarding our view on cloud. I think I will ask Sumit
just to add some further color on that. And Sumit, maybe you can just take the China
question as well.
Sumit Sadana
Yes, sure. So, Krish, very quick on the cloud discussion. As Sanjay mentioned, the
CapEx trends for our customers in the cloud space continue to be pretty strong and
the end demand for cloud services and the growth in those cloud services continues
to be robust. And so, of course, like you also pointed out, I mean, the inventory levels
are higher compared to where they were pre-COVID. Now , it remains to be seen how
the macroeconomic environment is going to cause the cloud spending trends to
modulate over time. But if anything, we think that the cloud spending trends are
going to be pretty secular , pretty strong. Even if there is some kind of an impact, it
will come back strongly as things stabilize. And even companies that do focus on
tightening their belt in this macroeconomic environment will continue to look for ways
to become more efﬁcient, become more proﬁtable, improve their competitive
positioning. And that means extracting more value from data, digitization trends to
continue. So, those kind of things, we feel are going to be well sustained through the
environment that may happen. But of course, a lot depends on how the
macroeconomic environment evolves, and that’ s why we are staying very close with
customers.
Switching to your China question. China has been a pretty signiﬁcant impact to our
FQ4 trajectory . This time last quarter when we were contemplating our FQ4 trajectory
compared to that to our latest guidance that we have provided. Our view for China
revenue has come down by approximately 30%. And that reduction in the China
revenue has caused roughly a 10% reduction in our consolidated company-wide
revenue. And so, that’ s the impact to the Q4. It’ s pretty substantial. And the China
impact is largely driven by , of course, smartphone weakness, PC weakness, the
general consumer environment there has been weak due to the COVID shutdowns,
and that has percolated to dif ferent parts of the economy . So, the economic
environment is weak.
Now, we do feel like given the weakness in that economy , as you know , China does
tend to provide stimulus to improve the ﬁnancial and economic conditions, and we
are hopeful that that kind of stimulus and improvement in the economy will be
forthcoming in the quarters ahead. The timing of that and how it plays out with further
COVID-related issues in China is unclear . But we remain optimistic that over time,
the consumer demand will come back and improve things.

Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS.
Timothy Arcuri
I guess I had two questions. The ﬁrst one is for you, Mark. The buyback this quarter
was great. But I guess -- and you did say that you’re going to buy back more in
August. But I guess I had a bigger picture question around sort of you have an
opportunity now with the stock where it is. You have leadership in terms of
technology . Where would you be willing to take cash balance to take advantage of
this price weakness? I mean, is there a sort of a minimum cash balance that we can
think of where you could sort of opportunistically buy back a fairly signiﬁcant piece of
the Company?
Mark Murphy
Yes. Tim, I’m not going to comment on deﬁnitively about our rate and pace. As you
point out, the balance sheet is stronger than ever . And I think what’ s most important
there is we’re in a great position to sustain long-term investments as the markets a
bit softer here. W e’ve got $14.5 billion of liquidity , which you point out, $12 billion of
that’s in cash. And that is above a liquidity target that we had set of about 35%.
We’re 10 points over that. Leverage is low , 0.4% on gross and we’re in a net cash
position. So, no near-term maturities, average debt maturity out 2031. So we’re in
great shape.
I think we want to maintain a balance sheet to be able to focus on the long term of
the business. As you point out, we did return historically high levels to shareholders
in third quarter .
At these share price levels, we project opportunistic repurchase to increase. And
then from there, we’re just focused on free cash ﬂow growth, returning excess cash
to shareholders and importantly , maintaining investment-grade rating. So, I’d say , we
have ample liquidity now to repurchase at a higher rate this quarter .
Timothy Arcuri
Cool. Thanks for that. And I guess, second question also, Mark, for you. What does
the guidance assume for your inventories in August? And sort of how do you think
about sort of the balance between holding some inventory if you believe that data
center will stay strong and sort of how should we think about inventory in August and
sort of your bigger picture strategy around keeping some inventory on the bet that
cloud does remain strong?
Mark Murphy
It’s a good question, Tim. And you heard Sanjay talk about this brieﬂy in his prepared
remarks. Our strategy is to manage supply through inventory as a buf fer and we did
talk about reducing bit supply growth assumptions a bit. W e are starting this sort of
softer period in a pretty good place. W e ended the third quarter $5.6 billion of
inventories, 109 days, down from 1 13 days in 2Q. So, we do expect inventories to go
up this quarter . And that will build in some ﬂexibility as we work to optimize price on
our products. I want to note, it’ s cost-ef fective inventory , much of it built on leading
nodes. And so, it will be competitive for a long time. And then, we’ll also use this
inventory build to revisit some CapEx decisions and defer CapEx, optimize the
manufacturing footprint where we can. And to CJ’ s earlier question, it gives us more
conﬁdence that we can lower WFE spend next year .
So, in the -- we expect it to go up a couple of weeks and days in the fourth quarter .
From there, we’ll have to see how the market develops and which way it moves. W e
are -- we do have more complex wafer processing and more complex module
products that are sort of adding some pressure on the days, but we’re also of fsetting
that with better cycle time, lower stock levels and so forth.
So, I think the days that we would be uncomfortable with is a number that we’ve
talked about in the past, around 150 days where we start to -- that’ s too high a level.
So, we would deﬁnitely go up in the fourth quarter , and then we’ll see where
inventory levels go from there.
Operator
Our next question comes from V ivek Arya of Bank of America.
Vivek Arya
Sanjay , I’m curious, do you think this Q4 outlook is the bottom of the cycle, or do you
think the risks can extend into Q1? Because you mentioned that the consumer
headwinds could continue to play out during the second half of the calendar year and
also because cloud inventory is at elevated levels. So, I guess, my speciﬁc question
as much as I realize you don’t guide out more than a quarter is, do you think Q1
sales and margins are more likely to be ﬂat, up or down sequentially?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So clearly , we don’t guide to Q1 here. But as I pointed out in the prepared remarks
that we expect these inventory adjustments to be working themselves out over the
course of second half of the year . We have pointed out that the inventory
adjustments primarily are taking place in PC and the smartphone market.
And I’ll just point out that from the past history as well, that once inventory
adjustments begin in a certain part of the segment, then it takes a couple of quarters
for them to work out. And here, we, of course, have macroeconomic uncertainties as
well. It has been a rapidly changing and uncertain environment. And this is what we
have to keep in mind when we look at when does normally see return in terms of
demand. And that’ s why , just like Mark pointed out here in response to the last
question, we will be using inventory to address the demand next year . And we will
continue to closely with our customers to understand their overall demand
environment.
We think that sometime in ﬁscal ‘23 is when -- in our ﬁscal ‘23 is when demand will
rebound, but more importantly , it’s really about the supply-demand balance. And with
respect to supply-demand balance, you can see, that we are taking actions
immediately in terms of curtailing our supply growth for ﬁscal year ‘23 by sharing the
plans with you that we are bringing down our CapEx versus our estimations earlier .
So, that’ s an important step. And of course, industry has shown that in DRAM that it
has CapEx discipline as well. W e believe our actions will also contribute toward
returning the industry health sooner .
So, I would expect that sometime in our ﬁscal year ‘23 demand will rebound as well
as industry demand supply environment, there’ s a store to a healthy level. But again,
I will point out that, look, this is a highly uncertain rapidly changing environment. W e
are, of course, responding fast and -- in terms of any changes we see. So we are not
been pointing to any speciﬁc quarter at this time.
And again, I think what’ s also important is that Micron execution continues to be
really strong. I mean, whether you look from technology , product, manufacturing,
customer relationships and of course, our strong balance sheet, we are well poised
to emerge stronger on the other side of this downturn. So, we are really executing
well, working closely with our customers to understand the latest demand trends in
various end market segments and adjusting our plans as necessary and as fast as
we can, and really positioning the Company for overall healthy growth in the long
term.
And again, the long-term trends -- as Sumit also pointed out earlier , and I shared with
you, the long-term trends absolutely bode well for memory and storage.
Vivek Arya
How much is cloud inventory above a normal level, $100 million, $200 million? Any
kind of rough estimation of how much of incremental headwind is that, so we can
take that into account? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Look, I mean, it really varies by customer to customer , right? So I mean, we can’t
exactly give you some of those details here.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.
Ambrish Srivastava
Sanjay , good to see the ﬁnancial and the CapEx discipline. With respect to supply
growth and you’re ramping down supply growth heading into ﬁscal -- for ﬁscal ‘23.
What’ s the right way to think about demand growth? And so, within the supply
meeting demand, how much do you think will be production growth, production
supply versus coming from the inventory from the industry? Because I think the
industry seems to be consistent in that, at least what we heard a week or two ago
from one of your large competitors is also lowering CapEx. So, that’ s the good part.
But what -- how should we think about inventory on the balance sheet of the three
participants adding to the production supply growth? And then, I had a quick follow-
up for Mark as well, please.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So look, I mean, we are in the process of ﬁrming up our plans. And when we have
our FQ4 earnings call in September , of course, we will share with you some more
details around calendar year ‘23. That will be more appropriate time for us to be
talking about it, as well as our ﬁscal year ‘23. But again, the important thing to note is
that our inventory is highly cost ef fective. I mean, Micron is leading the industry with
our DRAM and NAND production nodes, right? W e are several quarters ahead.
So, this is a highly cost-ef fective inventory . Our manufacturing operations are running
well. So, we will be using this inventory in ﬁscal year ‘23 and of course, continue to
adjust our plans as necessary on the CapEx and front-end wafer technology ramps,
et cetera, to bring balance into demand and supply , and which is what I pointed out
earlier that overall, the combination of our inventory as well as new production
growth that’ s how we’re positioned to bring that into balance to meet the demand
sometime in ﬁscal ‘23.
Ambrish Srivastava
Got it. And Mark, real quick one on the WFE versus non-WFE, what’ s the
percentage? And I respect the fact that plans are still in ﬂux, so you can’t give us a
number for ‘23. But what’ s the number expected to be for this year , please? Thank
you.
Mark Murphy
I’m sorry , Ambrish. I couldn’t hear the question.
Ambrish Srivastava
Sorry . My question was, what’ s the wafer front end versus non-wafer front end spend
in the CapEx for this year?
Mark Murphy
Okay . I got the mix of spend. I won’t give an exact number because the mix varies
from year-to-year and depends on product cycles, availability of fab space and
facilities and other factors. Over half of CapEx generally is manufacturing WFE, and
then, the other half is split between development CapEx and construction.
Ambrish Srivastava
So, when you say you will be -- you could take down construction as well, that
means construction as well as development, or what’ s the right way to think about
the kind of the playbook is what everybody is looking for if things continue to…
Mark Murphy
Just to be speciﬁc, we’re talking about WFE for manufacturing, and that’ s what I was
addressing would go down year-over-year . We did not commit to going down year-
over-year on construction, nor on technology development. I did say though that
depending on how the market plays out here and inventory levels and supply bit
growth and so forth, we continue to look at our footprint. That’ s a continuous process
to optimize the amount of spend.
So, again, just to make sure that’ s clear , WFE over half, and then the rest is
construction spend -- equipment spend for R&D and assembly and test.
Ambrish Srivastava
Got it. Thank you. And again, I apologize if misinterpreted your comments. Thank
you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of W ells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers
I just wanted to ask in this environment, these last couple of quarters and at the
Analyst Day , you emphasized how much of your business you had kind of line of
sight in terms of kind of the long-term agreements that you’ve established. I’m
curious, as we’ve gone through this kind of correction or downturn, how would you
characterize your discussions on those long-term commitments? Have they changed
at all? Have customers pushed back on taking the amount of previously committed
supply from you guys. How has that changed at all as we go through this kind of
correction right now?
Sanjay Mehrotra
That’ s a great question, and I will have Sumit address it.
Sumit Sadana
Yes. Happy to talk about that. So, the long-term agreements, generally , we go out
four quarters, talk about volume in each quarter . And as I have pointed out in the
past, these are not meant to be take-or-pay agreements, but more meant for
planning and shared assumptions and so on. W e have had extensive discussions.
We keep having ongoing dialogue with our customers about the environment. W e
obviously continue to press our customers to stick with the agreements and the
quarterly SKU, et cetera, as much as possible. But, when there are such signiﬁcant
extraneous events that are happening, exogenous shock sometimes to the
environment and such unpredictable type of situations that Sanjay was highlighting,
fast-changing environment that is causing impact to the end demand, especially
given some of the consumer spending shifts that are happening in the world that are
causing reductions in purchasing of certain electronics products, PCs, smartphones,
et cetera. Then it is not possible for our customers to purchase based on the L TAs
that were established when the assumptions around the industry were very dif ferent.
And so, our goal then is to work with our customers to come up with the best
approach and ﬁgure out how best to position ourselves in terms of the forward-
looking views of their purchasing patterns. And this is where I feel like the product
momentum that we have had has played out really well.
We just mentioned that our data center SSD revenue doubled in the most recent
quarter year-on-year . We have tremendous product portfolio momentum across all of
our products. W e are shipping in volume, HBM products. W e have the world’ s fastest
graphics DRAM product, ﬁrst to market with low power DRAM and mobile and really
strong capability in automotive, number one share in auto, industrial and networking.
So, these all play to our strengths with our customers. So, in the areas where we
want to improve our portfolio position, improve our share because they are more
stable segments in the market or they are more proﬁtable portions of the industry
proﬁt pool. That’ s where we focus on. And then our portfolio strength really helps
enable that transition with customers to make our own business more optimized and
more proﬁtable, more steady over time.
So, that’ s the engagement that we have with customers. And we use those L TAs to
then drive those longer-term goals that we have with customers.
