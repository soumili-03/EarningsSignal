Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Farhan. Good afternoon, everyone.
Micron delivered ﬁscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range, with gross
margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories
and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand, while production
cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply . As a result, pricing
trends are improving, and we have increased conﬁdence that the industry has
passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth.
Our technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well
across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond
this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025 along with a return to
more normalized levels of proﬁtability .
The impact of the May 21 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on
Micron's business remains uncertain and ﬂuid. Several Micron customers, including
mobile OEMs, have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure
operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of
Micron products. As discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies
headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as
indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately a quarter of Micron's
worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure.
We currently estimate that approximately half of that China-headquartered customer
revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide
revenue, is at risk of being impacted. This signiﬁcant headwind is impacting our
outlook and slowing our recovery . Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time
and expects increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability . Micron's long-term goal
is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share.
Turning to technology . Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and
NAND technology . We are investing prudently to maintain our technology
competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to
reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM
and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields, and the yield ramp for
these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes
provide a strong cost capability , along with best-in-class power and performance
speciﬁcations that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND
products. In ﬁscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualiﬁcations on these
advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in ﬁscal 2024.
We are also making good progress toward the introduction of our EUV -based 1-
gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured ﬁrst in our Taiwan site, where
we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp.
We also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima,
Japan, with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the ﬁrst company
to bring EUV technology to Japan for production.
We are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our
product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the
future. In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the
next several years in our operations in Xi'an. This builds on our long history of
signiﬁcant investment in our Xi'an assembly , packaging and test operations.
As a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment
of our partner Powertech Semiconductor Xi'an, who has been operating inside our
Xi'an facility for the last eight years. W e also intend to construct a new building at our
Xi'an site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over
time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xi'an site.
In India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new
assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this
decade. W e are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in
Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in
this segment driven by the AI wave.
Now turning to our end markets. Customers continued to make progress in reducing
their excess inventory in ﬁscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and
smartphone segments are close to normal levels now , consistent with our forecast
six months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer
attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and
unsustainable at these levels, to purchase additional volumes before prices rise
signiﬁcantly . Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely
normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter , depending
on the growth in traditional data center spending.
In data center , we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise
in ﬁscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in ﬁscal Q2. The
recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected
industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server
demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster .
Micron's product portfolio and roadmap of innovative products position us to capture
growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both
training and inferencing.
Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters
are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content.
As we have said before, AI servers have six to eight times the DRAM content of a
regular server and three times the NAND content. In fact, some customers are
deploying AI compute capability with substantially higher memory content. A striking
example is NVIDIA's DGX GH200 supercluster , which shows just how memory-
intensive AI workloads can be; it provides developers the ability to support giant
models with a massive, shared memory space of 144TB. A signiﬁcant majority of that
memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our two
companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server class
applications. W e are proud to pioneer this dif ferentiated LP  DRAM innovation to
deliver a signiﬁcant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-
based solutions, helping to support our customers' green initiatives.
High-bandwidth memory , used in high performance computing, is seeing very strong
demand this year , driven by demand for generative AI. W e are working closely with
our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product
offering. The customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product
delivers signiﬁcantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the
new benchmark in performance and power consumption, supported by our 1-beta
technology , TSV, and other innovations enabling a dif ferentiated advanced packaging
solution. W e expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product
in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in ﬁscal 2024.
Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest
generation of DDR memory . Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than
doubled from ﬁscal Q2 to Q3, and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at
the end of ﬁrst calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry .
Micron's 1-alpha D5 modules are qualiﬁed and shipping to data center customers.
We are also making good progress on our 1-beta-based, high-density 128 gigabyte
D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide
customers with a lower cost-of-ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads
like AI. W e expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 with
signiﬁcant cost improvements over today's expensive TSV-based solutions in the
industry . Our 96 gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1-alpha technology , using
24 gigabit die, is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for
the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV dual-die package-based
128 gigabyte modules.
In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176-layer or 232-layer
NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. W e are in a strong
position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications
proliferate. In ﬁscal Q3, we launched the world's ﬁrst 200-plus layer NAND data
center SSD, and qualiﬁcation is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI
cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualiﬁcation of this product at a
critical server OEM partner . We also launched our extreme endurance data center
SSD, which of fers superior scalability and af fordability versus hard drives.
In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-
digit percentage year-over-year , with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID
levels last seen in 2019. W e are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5
and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry client D5 mix
is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024.
In ﬁscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments, driven by share
growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD
QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter , with
growth in both client and consumer . Last month, we launched Crucial T700, the
world's fastest Gen5 PCIe consumer SSD, built with our 232-layer NAND.
In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics' TAM growth CAGR to
outpace the broader market, supported by applications across client and data center .
We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. W e plan to introduce
our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the ﬁrst half of
calendar year 2024.
In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by a
mid-single digit percentage year-over-year . While units are weaker , we are seeing
stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and
elasticity . We expect sequential growth in ﬁscal Q4 as customers prepare for
upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023.
In ﬁscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualiﬁcations on our 1-beta-based
LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier-1 OEMs. In addition, we
achieved signiﬁcant milestones in UFS with the qualiﬁcation and ramp of a high-
capacity uMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabyte of NAND. W e
have also started to sample a new UFS 4 product based on our latest 232-layer
NAND technology , which enables industry-leading performance for ﬂagship
handsets.
Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our
revenue and contribute more stable revenue and proﬁtability .
Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for
us. In ﬁscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high
single-digit percentage year-over-year . We continue to expect growth in auto
memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory
semiconductor supply , normalizing customer inventory levels, and increasing
memory content per vehicle.
The industrial market saw early signs of recovery in ﬁscal Q3. Inventory levels are
stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result,
we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. W e are
excited about our growth prospects in this market, as industrial customers continue
to adopt and implement IoT , AI, and machine learning in the factory .
Now, turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit
demand growth have been further reduced to low- to mid-single digits in DRAM and
to high-single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of
mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20%s range in NAND. While the AI-
driven demand has been stronger than our expectations three months ago, the PC,
smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower . We continue to
expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the
calendar year , driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in
customer inventory .
While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower , the signiﬁcant
supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market. W e see
both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry
in calendar 2023 as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply
growth. While supply demand balance is improving, due to the excess inventory ,
proﬁtability and cash ﬂow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market
recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these
cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024.
In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring
our supply back in balance with demand. W e expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply
growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. W e also expect to produce fewer
NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022.
Our ﬁscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year , with
WFE down more than 50%. W e continue to expect ﬁscal 2024 WFE to be down year-
on-year . Recently , we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both
DRAM and NAND. W e currently expect reduced wafer starts will continue well into
calendar 2024 as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and
controlling our supply .
I will now turn it over to Mark.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay . Good afternoon, everyone.
Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in
above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the
high end of the range.
Total ﬁscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down
57% year-over-year . Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance
settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance.
Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion, representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM
revenue declined 2% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in the 10% range
and prices declining by approximately 10%.
Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue.
NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in the
upper 30% range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range.
Now turning to revenue by business unit.
Compute and Networking Business Unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1%
sequentially . Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was of fset by
a decline in client.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially . On a
sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong.
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due
to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues
in ﬁscal Q4.
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and
driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15
percentage points sequentially . This result was negatively impacted by approximately
$400 million or 1 1 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory
produced in the quarter .
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million
sequentially . OpEx beneﬁted from ongoing expense-reduction initiatives and gains
on sales of certain assets.
We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in ﬁscal Q3, resulting in an operating
margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter .
Fiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our
guidance, driven by one-time discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters,
despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in
certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies.
The non-GAAP  loss per share in ﬁscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of
$1.91 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year . Fiscal Q3
EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-
down associated with inventory produced in the quarter .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. Our operating cash ﬂows were
approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter .
We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the
ﬁscal year , thus near $1 billion in ﬁscal Q4. Free cash ﬂow was negative $1.4 billion
in the quarter and improved from the previous two quarters.
Our ﬁscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days. Due to increases in
process steps and product complexity , we now target inventory levels of around 120
days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current
inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels
associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation.
At quarter-end, we held cash and investments of $1 1.4 billion and had total liquidity
of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility .
We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter and, with part of those
proceeds, paid down $600 million of our term loan facility , resulting in a net increase
to debt of $900 million. Our ﬁscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal fourth quarter . As mentioned in ﬁlings and
our comments today , the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. W e expect the
revenue impact to vary by quarter , with the impact in ﬁscal Q4 being less than the
quarterly impact in the ﬁrst half of ﬁscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining
our global market share in both DRAM and NAND. In ﬁscal Q4, as the industry
demand continues to improve and despite the ef fects on our business from the CAC
decision, we still see record bit shipments.
Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing
levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our
DRAM and NAND proﬁtability is signiﬁcant, and changes in the mix can drive large
variability in gross margins. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate
additional write-downs of inventory . We continue to aggressively manage our
operating expenses and remain on track to exit the ﬁscal year at less than $850
million. Looking beyond ﬁscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in
ﬁscal Q1 2024 on R&D program expense timing and as reductions to employee
compensation end.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q4 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in
the range of negative 10.5%, plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating
expenses to be approximately $845 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax
expenses of approximately $40 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1
billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19, plus or minus $0.07.
In closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn,
making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology ,
products, and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this
environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our proﬁtability and free cash
ﬂow. As market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efﬁciencies to hold on
productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and ef fects of the CAC
decision, we remain conﬁdent in our ﬁnancial model and our ability to deliver long-
term proﬁtability , cash ﬂow and shareholder returns.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark.
I am proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we made this
quarter . The leadership products we released and qualiﬁed are strengthening
Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets.
While there are near-term headwinds, I am excited about the new product
introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further
enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us. I am conﬁdent
that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability ,
manufacturing excellence, ﬁnancial discipline, and excellent customer relationships,
will position us well for the future.
I also want to call attention to Micron's 2023 sustainability report, which published
yesterday . The report underscores our continued commitment to innovation, the
environment, our people and the communities where we operate, outlining our
progress and aspirations across our environmental, social and governance
programs. I encourage you to review the full report on Micron's website.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . [Operator Instructions] And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of C.J.
Muse from Evercore ISI. Your question please.
C.J. Muse
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess ﬁrst question, with
inventory expected to normalize in the coming months -- quarter , how are you seeing
customer purchasing behavior perhaps change given that we're clearly hitting a
pricing trough very soon? W e'd love to hear kind of how those discussions might be
changing.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thanks, C.J., for that question. W e, of course, continue to work closely with our
customers. And as we said that customer inventories are improving. Except for data
centers, inventories are close to normal in most of our other end markets. Data
center , we said by end of this year or somewhat thereafter -- shortly thereafter , data
center customer inventories we expect to improve as well. And we continue to work
closely with our customers. Some of the customers deﬁnitely interested in some of
the longer-term outlook for the business and other customers operate on month-to-
month basis.
And overall, of course, we continue to mitigate through some of the impact of the
China decision as well. But the value that we are bringing to the customers for our
products continues to strengthen and Micron is very much focused on navigating
through the current downturn and working closely with our customers to address
their future demand.
And as we said in my remarks that some of the customers, given the low pricing that
exists in the industry today , and before prices begin to increase substantially , some
of the customers may be looking at purchasing additional volumes at this time. But in
general, the trajectory is of continuing improvement in their inventory levels end-to-
end across the supply chain, add the customers directly as well as third parties who
may be supplying to the customers. And as you know , inventories at the suppliers
are coming down as well.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful. If I could just follow-up real quickly on HBM3, you guided to meaningful
revs in ﬁscal '24. Can you give us a sense of what that means? And over time, what
size kind of could that look like for you guys looking at kind of three to ﬁve years?
Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, with respect to HBM3, we are very excited about this product. Micron has
focused on bringing an industry-leading product and HBM3 product that is in early
stages of sampling and we expect to begin production volume ramp of this product in
early 2024. It is a product that has signiﬁcantly higher performance, bandwidth and
signiﬁcantly lower power . In fact, as a product, it is close to a generational leap
ahead of anything else that is in the market.
We have received a strong endorsement for this product in the market and we
expect the volume ramp of this product for us to be rapid, to be steep ramp and this
will bring in, in our ﬁscal year 2024, strong revenue growth opportunity for us. So we
are very excited about this standout product. It will be a signiﬁcant growth driver for
Micron.
And everything that we have done here is of course built on our industry-leading 1-
beta technology and applying to it, of course, advanced packaging, dif ferentiated
packaging and TSV capabilities. So this is we believe going to be a standout product
for us. And we expect -- we target a share with HBM with this kind of industry-leading
product that would be higher than our average DRAM share in the industry as well.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I had two. Mark, the ﬁrst one is for you. I was wondering if you can sort
of lay out what the ﬁscal Q4 guidance would have looked like net of the ban. I know
you said that the impact from the ban gets worse actually in the ﬁscal ﬁrst half. So is
it as simple as maybe ﬁscal Q4, you had said low double-digit bit impact, but it
sounds like it's probably that big in ﬁscal Q4. So something less than that in ﬁscal Q4
and then you sort of expand to a number something in that range in the ﬁrst half of
ﬁscal 2025 -- '24 rather? Can you sort of handicap that for us and shape it for us?
Mark Murphy
Yes. W e had a small impact -- very small in Q3. It's a more material impact in Q4. W e
do expect the impact to increase. However , our actions to mitigate that will help
offset the ef fect. But really , at this time, it's a headwind, but there's -- and that's clear .
However , we are taking mitigating actions and it's very uncertain, continues to evolve
on what the impact will be. And again, the impact that we see in the fourth quarter ,
it's contemplated in our guidance.
Timothy Arcuri
Got it. Maybe I'll ask you in the follow-up. But my second question is for Sanjay . So,
Sanjay , I asked you this last call, too. So you alluded to the smartphone customers at
least wanting to kind of get out in front of what they see maybe could be some
tightness and maybe they're opportunistically trying to take advantage of pricing
being so low . Can you just talk more broadly about what might change in your
relationship with your customers coming out of this downturn? I mean, could we be
headed toward a situation where maybe the data center customers that pushed you
and your peers so far during the downturn that maybe we can talk about L TAs at
some point. I know that this is a ways away , given kind of where we are today . But
can you just talk about maybe over the past three months, when I asked you last
time, how the tone of the discussion with the data center customers in particular has
changed? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, our customers, of course, work with us on L TAs. And as we have said, L TAs
relate to their forecast for the year , generally . And while some customers may be
operating on shorter term or other customers longer term, but generally speaking,
they operate on yearly L TAs and L TAs involve supply and demand commitments
from the two sides. Of course, sometimes with the changing industry environment on
either side, on the supply or on the demand side, there can be adjustments made to
those L TAs, and we work closely with our customers in those regards.
And we have had close relationships with the customers. W e have a very strong
product momentum. You are particularly inquiring about data center . And let me tell
you that our product momentum in data center with strong portfolio of solutions,
particularly addressing the growing interest in AI, in data center , generative AI,
becoming a big opportunity , and we look at it for 2024 as a big year for AI and for
memory and storage and Micron will be well positioned with this product.
And these are all parts of our discussions when we address their requirements on
their future purchases when we address L TA requirements. And of course, we need
the necessary investments related to our production mix in terms of die
requirements, in terms of our assembly and test requirements, and we really work
closely with our customers to help manage these.
And just keep in mind that -- as I mentioned, that a lot of new product considerations
go into the L TAs as well, as well as, of course, the volume and overall demand and
supply considerations. So L TAs, at the end, really help both the parties. They help us
plan our engineering, our product roadmap, alignment on that, our investments in
things such as back-end capacity because products like HBM, product like high-
density modules and, of course, in the mobile sector , products like MCPs, et cetera,
have all dif ferent considerations at the back end. And these are the kind of things,
LTAs really help us plan with our customers.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar
Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the good results. Sanjay , the ﬁrst
question I wanted to ask you was you spoke about AI servers having 6 to 8 times
more DRAM content and that demand is strong while traditional data center server
demand is weak. There's a view that some of these AI servers are replacing over 10
of the DCs -- regular DC servers. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about
overall DRAM demand as AI grows but probably cannibalizes some of your regular
data center server DRAM content? And then, I have a follow-up.

So look, when we look at the overall DRAM demand, the DRAM TAM, of course, the
AI is driving growth. Automotive, certainly driving growth. Other end markets, such as
we mentioned, mobile and PC, in terms of -- or consumer , in terms of their end
demand, has been somewhat lackluster . The AI demand that is driven in data center ,
whether it is in the enterprise deﬁnitely drives healthy trends for memory growth. Yes,
enterprise server and some of the data center demand has been recently somewhat
impacted by the macro trends, but the trend of AI and more memory is absolutely
continuing. And that's what -- when we look at our overall 2023 demand growth and
the projections of CAGR that we have ahead of us, we have taken those into
account.
This is very , very early innings for AI, and AI is really pervasive. It's everywhere in, of
course, cloud applications, enterprise server applications, applications such as
generative AI would be in enterprises too. Because due to conﬁdentiality of data,
enterprises will be building their own large language models. And as you know , while
the enterprise large language models may not be as large as the large language
models you may see, and examples such as super clusters, et cetera, but all of them
are really tending towards greater number of parameters. Now we are talking about
parameters with generative AI getting into even trillion parameter range. Not too long
ago, these used to be in 100 millions of range. That requires more memory .
So regardless of the applications, whether it is on the enterprise side or on the cloud
server side, the memory requirements are continuing to increase. And I'll just point
out that 6x to 8x that we have mentioned is the multiple of DRAM requirement in AI
server versus standard server . And of course, as we highlighted in the script, there
are many compute conﬁgurations, such as the supercluster example that we gave
you, where the DRAM content that is required is few hundred times higher than a
standard server .
So really , I think the journey here ahead of us will be very exciting. And when we look
at machine-to-machine communication, when we look at opportunities for the
virtuous cycle for the ever-increasing data that training applications, that inferencing
at scale and various edge applications, including automotive, are driving the
requirements for memory and storage will continue to grow well, and Micron is going
to be well positioned with our products.
And we consider 2024 to be a big banner year for AI, for memory and storage. And
Micron will be well positioned to capture this with our strong portfolio of products from
D5 to LP5 to HBM to high-density modules, even including graphics.
Krish Sankar
Got it. V ery helpful, Sanjay . And then a follow-up for Mark. You said no inventory
write-down in the current quarter expected. And if remember right, Mark, you also
mentioned in the past that inventory write-down is tight to your view on pricing three
quarters out. So is it fair to assume that you're expecting a pricing drop pretty much
this quarter? And if the CAC decision does get really worse that 15% to 25% of your
sales gets impacted, is there any more risk of inventory write-down, or is that
agnostic to the inventory write down? Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Yes. Thanks, Krish. Maybe I'll spend a few minutes just covering because it's a very
complicated topic with a lot of moving parts, maybe spend a bit of time on the topic.
So our reported gross margin, our outlook, it's a function of many factors, including
pricing. The inventory write-downs, which do include or incorporate our forward view
of pricing. The ef fects of utilization, which you heard today , we've increased -- or
reduced our wafer starts further . And then just volumes and associated leverage on
period costs as discussed in previous quarters, and of course, mix. These factors are
continuously changing due to market environment and our actions. And as I've stated
before at these lower levels of proﬁtability , our margin forecast and results are more
sensitive to slight changes in assumptions such as price.
Now given price trends and our current view on pricing and costs, we took a material
write-down in the second quarter as we reported $1.4 billion, took another $400
million this quarter . And with these write-downs, we've pulled forward inventory costs,
thus lowered the carrying value of on-hand inventories. Yes, as this lower cost
inventory clears in the future quarters, we'll realize more income in those quarters
than we would have otherwise without the charge.
So as an example, we took this $400 million of additional write-downs in third quarter
for inventories produced. And considering our latest views on volume mix, we also
realized a beneﬁt of near $300 million from selling through the lower cost inventories
impacted by the second quarter write-down.
So I do want to call out that it's -- with all the uncertainty , complexity and sensitivity at
these proﬁtability levels, our write-down and the beneﬁts that we had in the third
quarter were not far of f what we estimated in our guide. So I think that's a good
reﬂection of our handle of what's happening in the business.
Now we've also got underutilization ef fects, which are creating higher costs in
inventories and adding period costs. W e project roughly $1.1 billion of
underutilization impact in FY  '23 associated with the front end. Most of that will
impact the P&L  this year . Some of it will carry over to next year . But because of the
effect of the write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year than would
have otherwise. Beyond this period of write-down ef fects, the impact of lower wafer
starts between the period cost and the higher cost inventories, the ef fect is higher
single digits on margins, then down to mid and lower single digits on margins as
revenues increase.
So considering all this, just to give you a sense of proﬁle of margin and in turn
pricing, to your question, we said last quarter that we expect -- or as we said last
quarter , we expect -- we had a reported second quarter margin to be the trough, and
that was driven by the $1.4 billion write-down. With a much lower inventory charge
forecasted in the third quarter , which happened, that margin improved about 15
points. And then also, as mentioned last quarter , we said that fourth quarter would be
better than third quarter on a lower write-down, hence, we guided today 5 points
better than the third quarter . Again, these estimates are sensitive to pricing changes.
And -- but in our current view , we expect a gradual improvement on margin to
continue sequentially on a reported basis.
Now if you take our non-GAAP  third quarter gross margin of negative 16%, and we
were to strip out the write-down ef fects in third quarter , both the write-down portion
and the realized beneﬁt, and also to normalize, you strip out the insurance settlement
which we had in the third quarter , we would still be -- those two things largely of fset,
so we'd be still at about 16% negative gross margin. So again, over $100 million net
inventory ef fects, the $400 million write-down less than $300 million realized beneﬁt
and then the roughly the same over $100 million insurance settlement. So -- and this
is a function of the pricing environment, which we, I think, properly captured in our
guide.
Now that adjusted 16% -- that adjusted margin 16% is down clearly versus the
adjusted second quarter margin, which, as I recall, is about 7%, so down 23 points.
So under this adjusted view , we would trough on gross margin over the next few
quarters, and then we would improve of f these low levels through FY  '24. So this is a
proﬁle that's consistent with what we've discussed before, though the levels are a bit
lower and a bit delayed.
And so hopefully , that provide you some color both on how we see pricing and how
we see gross margin playing out with all the puts and takes.
Krish Sankar
Yes. Thanks a lot, Mark. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your question please.
Harlan Sur
Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess as a follow-up to that,
Mark, on your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter , I know there are no
inventory write-downs, but is it contemplating a step-up in underutilization charges or
period costs associated with underutilization charges sequentially? And because you
cut your wafer starts another 5 percentage points right to 30%, if you could maybe
quantify that step-up in underutilization charges? And then as a follow-up, is the
incremental 5% cut in utilization is primarily a result of the CAC restrictions?
Mark Murphy
It is not. It's more of an industry dynamic and our intent to get supply discipline in the
market. Supply needs to come out of the market given inventory levels, and that's the
principal driver .
As far as the ef fects of utilization, it is already incorporated in this guide. The period
costs in the fourth quarter are about $200 million. And again, they're contemplated in
the guidance.
Harlan Sur
Perfect. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. Your question please.
Ambrish Srivastava
Hi. Thank you very much. Mark, I wanted to come back to the gross margin. When
you had given the guidance for this quarter , you had walked us through in detail. And
you had said that stripping out all the adjustments and the industry write-down, 3Q
would be at 7.5%. Am I reading this right that now we stripped out as negative 16%,
right? So it's much worse than what you were thinking?
Mark Murphy
No, I don't think it's much worse than what we're thinking. If you strip out just the
underutilization ef fects, but you keep in the insurance settlement, you're close to
what we said, sort of that 7%, 8%. So that you need to consider . We had said that
was in there.
Ambrish Srivastava
Okay . Got it. And then a follow-up either for you or for Sanjay . On the 15% [big round]
(ph) number , 15% of bit loss -- share loss in China, how do you recoup that? Is that
based on the assumption that bit growth or bit supply will be constrained, and so if
the other two suppliers are able to meet the China demand, they'll leave some
demand out here -- in other regions for you to basically go after? Is there a pricing
element to that? I'm just not pretty sure I understand how [you hit that] (ph).
Sanjay Mehrotra
I will take that. So what we have said is that approximately 50% of our business in
China is at risk of getting impacted. And of course, we are focused on mitigating any
share loss with CIIOs or as a result of CAC decision, with those customers -- global
customers who are not impacted by CAC decision. So keep in mind that our share in
DRAM is approximately 23% and our share in NAND is approximately 12%. So
obviously , we have opportunities to gain share with other customers. And this is what
we are focused on. It will take some time, and the CAC decision can -- I mean, as we
have said, it is hurting our business. It is slowing our recovery . It can result in quarter-
to-quarter variations as well. But over longer term, our target is to maintain our share.
So while near term, CAC decision is challenging, longer term, we will work with
customers who are not impacted -- our global customers who are not impacted by
CAC decision to increase our share. And we have a long history of working with our
customers. W e have brought tremendous value of our innovation, our supply , our
product portfolio supporting their innovation and roadmaps in the marketplace. Our
customers want to see a strong Micron. Our strategy of keeping our target share
consistent over longer term with our current share is understood by our customers
because, again, they want to see a strong Micron, so they are supportive of this. And
we will continue to work with our customers. And of course, as we bring value to our
customers with our products and our product portfolio, we will focus on ROI on our
investments, and we'll certainly focus on improving the proﬁtability of our business
from current levels as well.
So we will, of course, keep proﬁtability in mind. And again, it's important that Micron
is a strong partner to our customers. And I think customers understand that multiple
strong players in the industry is a beneﬁt for multiple reasons to our customer
ecosystem.
Ambrish Srivastava
All right. Makes sense. Thank you, Sanjay .
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our ﬁnal question for today
comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays. Your question please.
Tom O'Malley
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Recently , we've been picking up that there
is a change in some of the A series where you're starting to see some HBM2E use
just given the fact that there's limited capacity of HBM3. I guess part one is, are you
seeing an ability to service that market today? And then, the second part of the
question is, you're saying that AI servers see about 6x to 8x DRAM content. I
assume that contemplates HBM, but you guys are talking about some AI tailwinds
today when you're really not servicing that market as much. So could you talk about
what you're seeing ex-HBM as the multiplier ef fect on DRAM today , just so we can
get a picture of how you guys are seeing the improvement in data center where they
are today ex that product? That would be really helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So certainly , we have had HBM2E product in the marketplace that actually gave us
strong experience in bringing up our technology and production capability with HBM.
The market, as I mentioned, is -- has shifted -- is shifting to HBM and Micron's
HBM3+ product, which I called as a generational leap ahead of anything in the
industry is going to position us well as we bring that into volume production during
the course of our ﬁscal year '24, starting early part of calendar '24, contributing to
several hundred million dollars of revenue opportunity over time.
And with respect to AI part of the market, I want to be very clear that, yes, with
respect to high-density modules and with respect to high bandwidth, HBM3 solutions,
that part of the market is growing this year , and it's an opportunity that we want to
capture, and I believe that we'll be well positioned to capture, as I mentioned, that we
will be targeting share in HBM with our absolute industry-leading product that's
higher than our DRAM industry average share.
So -- but it's important to understand is that AI is being served not only by HBM or
high-density DRAM modules, but it is also being served by D5 memory and by LP
DRAM as well. And this is where with the D5 and LP  DRAM products, we gave you
some examples in our script as well. A large amount of LP  DRAM being used in
industry-leading high-performance compute platforms. In fact, the 144 terabyte that
we mentioned in DGX, GH 200, about 122 terabyte of that is LP  DRAM. And Micron
is very well positioned with a dif ferentiated solution of our LP  DRAM there today .
So I think it's important to understand that the AI server market is made up of HBM,
it's made up of high-density DRAM modules, includes -- it also is made up of DDR5,
LP5 and some element of graphics memory as well. So, we do have a broad
portfolio. And in 2024 with HBM and high-density DRAM modules getting into
production, I really believe we'll be extremely well positioned to capture the growing
opportunity in AI. And 75% of DRAM on AI servers today is DDR5. And as I
emphasized, and as I'm sure you well know , we participate very well in D5. In fact,
we led the industry with our D5 products, again, built on 1-beta technology here.
Tom O'Malley
Thank you, Sanjay . And I appreciate you guys sneaking me in.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's
program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now
