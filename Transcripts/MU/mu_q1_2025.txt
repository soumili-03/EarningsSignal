Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Micron
achieved record revenue in ﬁscal Q1, with revenue, gross margins and EPS all at or
above the midpoint of our guidance range. Data center revenue grew over 400%
year-over-year and 40% sequentially , reaching a record level, with data center
revenue mix surpassing 50% of Micron’ s revenue for the ﬁrst time.
We delivered record revenue in data center SSDs and achieved new records in
market share for data center SSDs and overall SSDs. Our HBM shipments were
ahead of plan, and we achieved more than a sequential doubling of HBM revenue.
Revenue from our largest data center customer was approximately 13% of total
company revenue. The HBM market will exhibit robust growth over the next few
years. In 2028, we expect the HBM TAM to grow four times from the $16 billion level
in 2024 and to exceed $100 billion by 2030. Our TAM forecast for HBM in 2030
would be bigger than the size of the entire DRAM industry , including HBM, in
calendar 2024. This HBM growth will be transformational for Micron, and we are
excited about our industry leadership in this important product category .
Leading-edge DRAM supply remains tight, driven by robust demand in data center
DRAM, including HBM, which will underpin our business results throughout ﬁscal and
calendar 2025. W e had previously shared our expectation that customer inventory
reductions in the consumer-oriented segments and seasonality would impact ﬁscal
Q2 bit shipments. W e are now seeing a more pronounced impact of customer
inventory reductions.
As a result, our ﬁscal Q2 bit shipment outlook is weaker than we previously
expected. W e expect this adjustment period to be relatively brief and anticipate
customer inventories reaching healthier levels by spring, enabling stronger bit
shipments in the second half of ﬁscal and calendar 2025. W e are on track to achieve
our HBM targets and also deliver a substantial record in Micron revenue, signiﬁcantly
improved proﬁtability and positive free cash ﬂow in ﬁscal 2025.
Our technology roadmap continues to progress very well, and we are in production
with the industry’ s most advanced DRAM and NAND nodes. W e continue to ramp
our 1-beta technology node, which supports HBM3E, and we are preparing to ramp
our 1-gamma technology node using EUV in calendar 2025.
In NAND, we are maintaining technology leadership with our industry-leading G8 and
G9 nodes and are managing the ramp of these nodes consistent with our demand.
We expect ﬁscal 2025 DRAM front-end cost reductions, excluding HBM, to be in the
mid- to high-single digits percentage range. W e expect ﬁscal 2025 NAND front-end
cost reductions to be in the low-teens percentage range.
Earlier this month, we ﬁnalized an agreement with the U.S. Department of
Commerce for an award of up to $6.1 billion under the CHIPS and Science Act to
support advanced DRAM manufacturing fabs in Idaho and New York. Additionally , we
have entered into a preliminary memorandum of terms with the U.S. Department of
Commerce for an award of up to $275 million for our V irginia fab that supports
production of long-lifecycle chips in areas such as automotive, industrial, aerospace
and defense and enables efﬁciencies across our global fab network.
With the support of the Singapore government, we have ﬁnalized plans to expand
our manufacturing footprint in Singapore, starting with an investment for a new HBM
advanced packaging facility . This investment allows us to meaningfully expand our
total advanced packaging capacity beginning in calendar 2027 to support AI-driven
demand and will be synergistic with our existing operations in Singapore. These
plans also include support for our long-term manufacturing requirements for NAND.
Now turning to our end markets. Numerous advances are pushing the boundaries of
AI capabilities, as training model sizes continue to increase and inference models
evolve to address dif ferent use cases. Multimodal models, post-training and chain-of-
thought inferencing represent new frontiers of innovation, all of which are memory
intensive and can beneﬁt from higher memory bandwidth and capacity .
AI agents will become ever more capable and address vertical market consumer and
enterprise use cases, driving accelerating monetization of AI. Micron is
extraordinarily well positioned to leverage this long-term growth opportunity , which
has the potential to transform the dynamics of our business.
We have upgraded our view of server unit percentage growth and now expect it to
reach low teens in calendar 2024, fueled by strong AI demand, as well as a robust
traditional server refresh cycle, and we anticipate server unit growth to continue in
2025. Micron achieved new records in both total data center revenue and the
revenue mix for data center in ﬁscal Q1. Our portfolio of high-capacity DRAM
products, including monolithic die-based 128 gigabyte DIMMs and LP5-based server
DRAM products, continues to see robust demand and remains on track to generate
multiple billions of dollars in revenue in ﬁscal 2025.
We made excellent progress on HBM, more than doubling our revenue sequentially
during the quarter and exceeding our plans as a result of solid execution on yield and
capacity ramps. In ﬁscal Q1, our HBM gross margins were signiﬁcantly accretive to
both DRAM and overall company gross margins. W e are proud to share that Micron’ s
HBM3E 8H is designed into NVIDIA ’s Blackwell B200 and GB200 platforms. Micron’ s
HBM3E operates at full speed while maintaining leadership in power efﬁciency .
This month, we commenced high-volume shipments to our second large HBM
customer and will start high-volume shipments to our third large customer in CQ1,
expanding our HBM customer base. W e continue to receive positive feedback from
our leading customers for Micron’ s HBM3E 12H best-in-class power consumption,
which is 20% lower than the competition’ s HBM3E 8H, even as the Micron product
delivers 50% higher memory capacity and industry-leading performance.
We have increased our HBM market TAM estimate to now exceed $30 billion in
2025, and we continue to expect to achieve HBM market share commensurate with
our overall DRAM market share sometime in the second-half of calendar 2025. As
we have said before, our HBM is sold out for calendar 2025, with pricing already
determined for this time frame.
In ﬁscal 2025, we expect to generate multiple billions of dollars of HBM revenue. W e
are excited about Micron’ s HBM leadership roadmap through the rest of this decade.
Leveraging the strong foundation and continued investments in proven 1-beta
process technology , we expect Micron’ s HBM4 will maintain time to market and
power efﬁciency leadership while boosting performance by over 50% over HBM3E.
We expect HBM4 to ramp in high volume for the industry in calendar 2026.
Development work is well underway with multiple customers on HBM4E, which will
follow HBM4. HBM4E will introduce a paradigm shift in the memory business by
incorporating an option to customize the logic base die for certain customers using
an advanced logic foundry manufacturing process from TSMC. W e expect this
customization capability to drive improved ﬁnancial performance for Micron.
Based on our customer design wins and success in establishing deep partnerships
with customers, industry enablers and key technology partners like TSMC, we expect
to be a leading supplier of HBM, with the most robust, trusted and industry-leading
technology roadmap and execution record. Micron has also been leading the
adoption of LP  DRAM in data centers with NVIDIA ’s Grace CPU.
Micron’ s LP5X provides greater than 500 gigabyte of capacity and memory
bandwidth of greater than 540 gigabyte per second, thus delivering attractive
performance per watt for AI platforms. NVIDIA ’s Grace CPU utilizes Micron’ s LP5X to
provide systems with additional cache coherent memory to supplement HBM for the
ever growing memory needs of AI workloads.
Our overall SSD and data center SSD revenue reached new quarterly revenue
records in ﬁscal Q1, and we are on track to deliver another year of share gains in
calendar 2024. W e continue to strengthen our data center SSD product roadmap,
leveraging our leadership G8 NAND technology and vertical integration. W e
announced the 6550 ION SSD, which delivers the industry’ s fastest 60 terabyte SSD
and the ﬁrst in the industry with Gen5 capability at this capacity point.
Compared to the competition, Micron’ s 6550 ION SSD delivers 20% lower power
while providing 60% better performance and better data center footprint efﬁciency
with up to 67% more density per rack for exascale data centers. Our 9550 PCIe
Gen5 data center SSDs were qualiﬁed for the recommended vendor list for NVIDIA ’s
GB200 NVL72 system and of fer a 34% higher throughput and over 80% lower
energy per terabyte of data transfer versus the competition. W e continue to expect to
generate multiple billions of dollars in data center SSD revenue in ﬁscal 2025 and to
grow our market share once again in calendar 2025.
Turning to PC. The PC refresh cycle is unfolding more gradually , and we expect PC
unit volume growth to be ﬂattish in calendar 2024, slightly below prior expectations.
We remain optimistic about AI PC adoption over time. AI PCs will require additional
DRAM content, with a minimum of 16 gigabyte of DRAM for entry level PCs and 24
gigabyte and above for higher-end segments, versus 12 gigabyte average PC
content last year . Windows 10 end-of-life in October 2025 and an aging installed
base will provide a catalyst for PC market growth in 2025. W e expect PC market
units to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range in calendar 2025, with growth
weighted toward the second-half of the calendar year .
Turning to mobile, smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to
grow in the mid-single digit percentage range, and we expect low single-digit
percentage growth in 2025, both consistent with our prior expectations. AI adoption
continues to be a strong driver for mobile DRAM content growth, where we see the
technology used in applications such as local search and contextually aware user
interfaces increasing over time. DRAM content growth remained robust in CQ3, with
the mix of smartphones with 8 gigabyte or greater growing to over 60%, signiﬁcantly
higher than a year ago.
Smartphone customer inventory dynamics continue to play out as expected, and we
expect bit shipments to be weighted to the second-half of our ﬁscal year . Micron
remains focused on the high end of the mobile market. W e are leveraging our
industry-leading portfolio of DRAM and NAND products to support the most
demanding applications, which will require increased content, high performance and
power efﬁciency .
Turning to the automotive market, lower than expected automotive unit production,
combined with a shift toward value-trim vehicles from premium models and EVs, has
slowed memory and storage content growth and resulted in inventory adjustments at
OEMs. Longer term, we remain optimistic that ADAS, infotainment and AI adoption
across auto will drive long-term memory and storage content growth. Industrial
market demand continues to be impacted by inventory adjustments, and we expect a
recovery in this market later in calendar 2025.
Now, turning to our market outlook. W e expect industry DRAM bit demand growth to
be in the high-teens percentage range in calendar 2024 and in the mid-teens
percentage range in calendar 2025. W e see overall calendar 2025 DRAM industry bit
supply growing roughly in line with bit demand, with tightness in leading edge nodes
driven by HBM supply ramp in the industry .
Our outlook for industry NAND bit demand growth in both calendar 2024 and 2025 is
now in the low-double-digits percentage range, which is lower than our prior
expectations. Key drivers include slower growth in NAND content in consumer
devices, ongoing inventory adjustments and demand dynamics in dif ferent end
markets, as outlined earlier , and a temporary moderation in near-term data center
SSD purchases by customers after several quarters of very rapid growth.
In data center , we remain enthusiastic about long-term demand growth as NAND is a
key enabler for AI workloads, providing faster data access, lower power and better
overall total cost of ownership essential for AI infrastructure. In the next few years,
we also expect high-capacity NAND SSDs to start displacing capacity HDDs in the
data center , an inﬂection that will drive long-term NAND demand growth. The decline
in 2024 and 2025 industry NAND demand growth outlook implies that supply actions
will be necessary to achieve balance.
As mentioned previously , since NAND technology transitions provide a signiﬁcant
increase in overall bit output, the pace of technology transitions will also need to slow
in order to align supply to industry demand. Micron is decisively taking actions to
align our NAND supply with industry demand trends. W e have reduced NAND CapEx
versus prior plan and have slowed the pace of technology node transitions.
In addition, we are reducing NAND wafer starts by a mid-teens percentage versus
prior levels. These actions will align our supply to current market demand. Consistent
with analyst reports, we have seen an increase in bit supply at legacy technology
nodes from a China-based DRAM and a China-based NAND supplier . In calendar
2024, analyst reports indicate that China-based supply will represent a mid-single-
digit percentage of industry bit supply for DRAM and a high-single-digit percent of
supply for NAND.
Competition from China supply is focused on China market demand in DRAM with
DDR4 and LP4 products and in NAND with consumer , client and lower performance
mobile products. W e expect Micron’ s worldwide revenue related to LP4 and D4
DRAM products for the remainder of ﬁscal 2025 to be approximately 10%. W e expect
Micron’ s sales of products to China-headquartered customers to be concentrated in
the high end of our customers’  portfolio, leveraging our technology and product
leadership and the performance and quality requirements of our customers.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thank you, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered ﬁscal Q1
revenue and gross margins at the midpoint and EPS above the midpoint of the
guidance range. Total ﬁscal Q1 revenue was approximately $8.7 billion, up 12%
sequentially and up 84% year-over-year , and reached a new record.
Fiscal Q1 DRAM revenue was $6.4 billion, up 87% year-over-year , and represented
73% of total revenue. Sequentially , DRAM revenue increased 20%, with bit
shipments up in the low-double-digit percent range and prices increasing in the high-
single-digit percentage range. Strong sequential bit shipment growth in DRAM was
driven by demand in data center .
Fiscal Q1 NAND revenue was $2.2 billion, up 82% year-over-year , and represented
26% of Micron’ s total revenue. Sequentially , NAND revenue decreased 5%, with bit
shipments and prices both decreasing in the low-single-digit percentage range.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was up 46% sequentially to $4.4 billion and now represents over half of our
total revenue. CNBU revenue reached a new quarterly record, driven by cloud server
DRAM demand, as well as HBM revenues, which more than doubled sequentially in
the quarter .
Mobile Business Unit revenue was $1.5 billion, down 19% sequentially . As our
mobile customers focused on improving their inventory health, we shifted supply to
meet data center demand. Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.1 billion, down
10% sequentially . Auto, industrial and consumer customers continue to manage their
inventories lower . Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $1.7 billion, up 3%
sequentially . SBU revenue reached a new quarterly record, driven by record revenue
in the data center SSD segment.
In ﬁscal 2025, we expect Micron’ s revenue mix with companies headquartered in
mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales
through distributors, to be approximately mid-teens percent of our worldwide
revenue. This mix is impacted by market factors described earlier as well as by the
China CAC actions announced in May 2023.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q1 was 39.5%, improving 300 basis points
sequentially . Gross margin improvement was driven by higher pricing in DRAM,
improved product mix to data center in both DRAM and NAND, of fset partly by lower
pricing in NAND.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q1 were $1.05 billion, down $34 million sequentially
and beneﬁting from lower labor related costs and ongoing tight expense control. W e
generated operating income of $2.4 billion in ﬁscal Q1, resulting in an operating
margin of 27.5%, which was up approximately 500 basis points sequentially and up
48 percentage points from the year-ago quarter .
Fiscal Q1 adjusted EBITDA  was $4.4 billion, resulting in an EBITDA  margin of
50.6%, up 265 basis points sequentially and up 31 percentage points or $3.5 billion
from the year-ago quarter . Fiscal Q1 taxes were $333 million on an ef fective tax rate
of 14.1%, which was in line with our guidance.
Non-GAAP  diluted EPS in ﬁscal Q1 was $1.79, compared to $1.18 per share in the
prior quarter and a loss per share of minus $0.95 in the year-ago quarter . We
delivered ﬁscal Q1 EPS at the higher end of our guidance range.
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending, our operating cash ﬂows were
approximately $3.2 billion in ﬁscal Q1. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion,
resulting in free cash ﬂow of $1 12 million in the quarter .
Our ﬁscal Q1 ending inventory was $8.7 billion or 149 days, a decline of nine days
from the prior quarter and driven by DRAM. On the balance sheet, we held $8.7
billion of cash and investments at quarter end and maintained $1 1.2 billion of liquidity
when including our untapped credit facility . We ended the quarter with $13.8 billion in
total debt, low net leverage and a weighted average maturity on our debt of 2031.
Now turning to our outlook for the second ﬁscal quarter . We expect DRAM bit
shipments to decline sequentially and expect a meaningful sequential decline in
NAND bit shipments for reasons mentioned previously that are impacting near-term
demand. W e project our bit shipments to resume growth after ﬁscal Q2 and expect
second-half ﬁscal year bit shipments to be stronger than the ﬁrs-half.
We expect ﬁscal Q2 gross margins to be impacted by NAND industry conditions,
partly of fset by continued growth in HBM and data center DRAM. In addition to these
factors, we expect NAND under loading to af fect ﬁscal Q3 gross margins. W e
forecast operating expenses in ﬁscal Q2 to be approximately $1.1 billion, primarily
reﬂecting planned increases in R&D spending. W e expect ﬁscal 2025 OpEx to
increase by a low- to-mid-teens percent, below our prior mid-teens plan.
We continue to prioritize R&D programs, including for HBM, to capitalize on strong
growth ahead. W e expect both inventory dollars and days of inventory to increase
sequentially in ﬁscal Q2 on lower volumes. With stronger bit shipments, we expect
DIO to improve in the second half of the ﬁscal year . We expect to end ﬁscal 2025
with tight DRAM inventories, below our target levels.
For ﬁscal Q2 and the remainder of ﬁscal 2025, we estimate our non-GAAP  tax rate to
be in the mid-teens percent range. W e expect our ﬁscal 2026 tax rate to be in the
high-teens percentage range following Singapore’ s adoption of global minimum tax.
In ﬁscal Q2, we forecast net CapEx to be approximately $3 billion.
For ﬁscal 2025, we are prioritizing our investments to ramp 1-beta and 1-gamma
technology nodes, as well as greenﬁeld fab investments for DRAM, which will help
us support HBM and long-term DRAM demand. W e have cut our NAND CapEx and
are prudently managing the pace of our NAND technology node ramps to manage
our supply .
We expect overall CapEx spending in ﬁscal 2025 to be approximately $14 billion plus
or minus $500 million. The overwhelming majority of the ﬁscal 2025 CapEx is to
support HBM, as well as facility , construction, back-end manufacturing and R&D
investments.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q2 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $7.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in
the range of 38.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $1.1 billion, plus or minus $15 million. As mentioned, we expect the
ﬁscal Q2 tax rate to be in the mid-teens percent range. Based on a share count of
approximately 1.14 billion shares, we expect EPS to be $1.43 per share, plus or
minus $0.10.
In closing, Micron will remain circumspect and ﬂexible with all our spending, including
operating expenses and capital investments. W e are making disciplined investments
in DRAM and are driving the ramp of high bandwidth memory . In NAND, we are
taking prompt and decisive actions to cut our capital spending and cut our wafer
output to maintain supply discipline. W e expect to deliver a substantial revenue
record, signiﬁcantly improved proﬁtability and positive free cash ﬂow in ﬁscal 2025.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. At our 2022 Investor Day , we had laid out a bold plan to shift our
portfolio mix and to increase our share of high growth and less seasonal segments
from approximately 45% in ﬁscal 2021 to 62% in ﬁscal 2025. In ﬁscal Q1 2025, we
have already signiﬁcantly exceeded that goal, driven by strong demand for AI-
enabled solutions and reﬂecting Micron’ s technology , product and manufacturing
leadership. Micron is in the strongest competitive position in its history , and we
continue to gain share in all high-margin, strategically important product categories in
our industry while maintaining overall stable bit share in both DRAM and NAND.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . And our ﬁrst question for today comes from the line of CJ Muse from
Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
CJ Muse
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess ﬁrst question, could
you speak to what gives you the conﬁdence that we’re going to see a make quarter
kind of a seasonal pickup and/or cyclical pickup across both DRAM and NAND? And
I guess if there’ s any sort of sense of magnitude we should be thinking about for
each would be very helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
CJ, I’ll take this one. As we said, our FQ2 outlook is impacted by inventory
adjustments in consumer-oriented markets and, of course, the typical seasonality
that exists in CQ1 as well. And we have also seen some moderation in purchases of
data center SSDs after several quarters of rapid growth in that part of the market. So
that’s what is impacting our Q2 outlook here.
And yes we believe that customer inventories in the consumer-oriented markets will
improve in the spring time frame. Keep in mind that the sell-through that’ s happening
in these consumer-oriented markets like smartphone and PCs is okay . It’s more that
they have built inventory and therefore, their purchases are less than their sell-
through. And we saw that the inventories improved in CQ4 and we expect them to
improve further in CQ1 time frame.
So by spring time frame, we expect the inventories to -- at customers in the
consumer-oriented markets to improve and that’ s what will drive shipment growth in
the ﬁscal second half for us. And of course, data center SSD as well, we expect, it
tends to be that part of the market, data center storage can sometimes be lumpy ,
and we expect the data center storage demand, given the data center build-out that
is happening, continues to be happening, driven by AR demand growth will also
return toward growth in the ﬁscal second-half. That’ s why we said ﬁscal second half
stronger than the ﬁscal ﬁrst-half.
CJ Muse
Very helpful. And then a quick question to Mark. Can you help us with a little more
granularity in terms of the impact from NAND under loadings into the current guide
as well as whether there’ s an impact beyond that? And then for all of calendar ‘25, is
there a framework for thinking about the tailwind from increasing HBM mix in the
revenues? Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Sure, CJ. So let me start with providing granularity on the second quarter guide. So
we’re down 100 basis points ﬁrst to second quarter in the guide, and that’ s driven by
NAND. First, as Sanjay mentioned, the NAND industry market conditions were
weaker than we had expected and that consumer market, PC, smartphones demand
is weaker and inventory adjustments are occurring.
Secondly , NAND data center SSD volumes moderated. And so there’ s this period of
digestion, and that was, as we know , higher-margin NAND business. So those two
things are the principal driver . Of course, with revenue down in the guide $800
million, we see some negative leverage ef fects on ongoing period costs, but those
costs do not include underload charges in the second quarter . So those charges will
begin to af fect us in the third quarter .
And so in the third quarter , as NAND continues to have a period where there are
some challenging conditions into the calendar ﬁrst quarter and that improves through
the calendar year , our supply response in NAND will weigh on third quarter margins,
and it will somewhat constrain our ability to expand gross margins in the third
quarter .
Now beyond the third quarter , the business volume growth, AI-driven data center and
edge-driven growth, favorable mix ef fects, including HBM, where we talked about
multibillion and then just a more constructive environment, especially in DRAM,
where we have tight inventories on the leading edge and have indicated that we
basically were below our target and inventories by end of year . So we see the
conditions for margin expansion occurring after third quarter .
CJ Muse
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.
Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. I’m trying to get at what the magnitude of the revenue ramp is going to
be in the ﬁscal back half? And I’m sort of looking at what you were saying about
CapEx. You had said that it would be mid-30s of the full-year revenue. So if I take the
14 and which was a little better than what people thought, I think most people were
thinking 13.5. So you actually are doing a bit more CapEx. And if I divide by the mid-
30s, I get to a number like $40 billion for the ﬁscal year . Is that -- I’m not asking you
to guide the ﬁscal year , but I’m just asking you to provide some sort of magnitude for
like the ﬁscal back half versus the ﬁscal front half?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So let me just answer the ﬁscal second-half. And of course, the drivers of growth,
there would be improved inventory in consumer-oriented markets, data center SSD
demand resuming and of course, HBM, continued momentum in HBM. W e are
excited about our product position there. And we have indicated to you that in the
second-half of the calendar year , we target reaching our HBM share to be in line with
DRAM share and we are executing very well on the HBM momentum. So HBM is
also, of course, continuing to drive our revenue growth as you look ahead to the
second-half of the year .
And then just keep in mind that we have discussed smartphone and PC units, we
have provided you color in the script on those in calendar year 2025 as well. And
there will be increasing penetration of AI smartphone and PC units, which tend to
have higher DRAM content as well.
So all of these factors will contribute primarily AI from data center to edge, consumer
inventory adjustments, getting past the seasonality of CQ1, all of these will be the
factors that were determined that really give us optimism towards strong second-half
shipments and of course, a healthier revenue outlook in the second half as well. And
Mark, you can comment on the CapEx.
Mark Murphy
Yes. Tim, we made it clear we’re cutting NAND CapEx. W e are -- yes, there’ s still
going to be elevated levels of DRAM spend and our previous guidance of mid-30s
will be higher 30s percent of sales now .
Timothy Arcuri
Got it, Mark. Okay , thank you. And then I want to ask on the share repo. So in the 8-
K last week that was related to the CHIPS Act, they contain language that you can
only buy back to of fset dilution during the ﬁrst two years and really you’re only free to
jack up the repo more than that during years three to ﬁve to bring down share count.
How do you think about that in sort of in the broader capital return? Thanks, Mark.
Mark Murphy
Yes, Tim, we’re -- we don’t see any meaningful constraints on our ability to return
capital. Our ordinary course dividends are unaf fected. So we would still expect to pay
a dividend and grow that over time. W e are able to repurchase shares. During the
ﬁrst two years, we’re able to repurchase shares to help of fset stock comp
shareholder dilution. And then in years three through ﬁve, we’re unrestricted as
certain ﬁnancial and other conditions are met.
And we think those conditions are reasonable. They involve how much we’re
spending on R&D, how much we’re spending on CapEx and our credit and so forth.
And these things are how we would normally run the business in a shareholder and
broader stakeholder way . So we think that we don’t have any meaningful constraints
under the agreements.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay , thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of V ivek Arya from Bank of
America Securities. Your question, please.
Vivek Arya
Thanks for taking my question. So Sanjay , you upgraded the HBM TAM by , I think,
about 20% or so. What has changed to increase that estimate? And I think you kind
of kept your target share to be the same as before, even though I think you kind of
shifted it more to the second-half. But what is the bottleneck? Why can’t your share
get to the target level earlier? Is it just a matter of rolling out in dif ferent products? So
just what changed the TAM estimate? And then what is causing the change for you to
get to your target more in the second half rather than I think you said sometime in ‘25
before?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So we continue to work closely with our customers to assess the market
requirements, and we provide you updates and we, from time to time, update our
outlook. And based on our latest estimates with our customers and, of course, all the
build-out related to AI data centers and the tremendous opportunity and it is -- we
have increased our estimate from $25 billion to $30 billion for calendar year 2025.
And this is driven by increased demand, increased volume that will be required in
2025 for HBM. And just keep in mind that HBM just continues to be still in tight
supply in calendar year 2025.
And regarding our own momentum, we have a very strong momentum. W e
previously had said that sometime in calendar year 2025, we will reach our share
target in HBM to be equivalent to our DRAM industry share. And now as 2025 is
approaching, we are providing you further speciﬁcity around the timing, and we are
specifying that we’ll be reaching that in second-half of 2025.
Of course, HBM ramp up, just keep in mind, it was not long ago. It was FQ3 of ‘24
when we had indicated that we have over $100 million of revenue in HBM. W e are --
our team is doing a great job in continuing to ramp up the capacity , as well as yields.
We pointed out that in our FQ1 we delivered more HBM than our plan and our yields
were also ahead of our plan. So we continue to do well, and we are extremely
focused on ramping up capacity , continue to ramp up deals towards mature yields,
and we feel very conﬁdent about our opportunities for HBM in 2024.
We have said that we expect to reach multiple billions of dollars of revenue in the
coming year in 2025 so a tremendous opportunity . And we, of course, continue to
look forward to building the momentum of our roadmap from there on. absolutely
captured the opportunities we believe that HBM4 as well as 4E, which will be more
opportunities ‘26 and beyond time frame. W e will be in a strong leadership position
with our products. And we will, of course, capture the opportunities and remain
disciplined with respect to our investments as well.
Vivek Arya
Got it. And for my follow-up, Mark, just a few questions on gross margins. So you are
guiding Q2 sales down, but gross margins are only going down by 1 point. So is that
some of the tailwinds you’re seeing in HBM right of fsetting some of the unit impact.
So if there is a way to quantify how much lift is HBM providing? And then the other
thing I just wanted to clarify , did you say Q3 gross margins higher than Q2 gross
margin despite that NAND headwind? I just wanted to clarify that. So just how much
lift from HBM and then is Q3 higher than Q2 from what you said before? Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Yes. So V ivek, good questions. So we are in 2Q. W e are seeing deﬁnitely favorable
effects from both higher DRAM revenue as a mix of our total business and then the
favorable DRAM product mix, so HBM and other data center products. So those are
tailwinds in the second quarter , and we expect those to continue, but they’re more
than of fset by the headwinds, particularly NAND.
And then what I mentioned earlier to CJ’ s question was, while we continue to have
these DRAM positive mix ef fects, we are -- it will take some time and well into this
calendar ﬁrst quarter for the NAND market conditions to begin to improve. And then
we, of course, start to see data center SSD growth starting again, volume growth in
the third quarter . And then the -- but conditions there will still be weak. And then the
supply response costs will weigh on third quarter margins and will constrain our
ability to expand margins in the third quarter . Now beyond third quarter , we see
continued revenue growth, favorable mix ef fects more constructive markets and see
the opportunity for margin expansion from there.
Vivek Arya
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan
Stanley . Your question, please.
Joseph Moore
Great, thank you. My question was also on HBM. I guess how do you think about
market share there over the long-term? Should we think of your natural DRAM share
as being a limiter given that one of your competitors is struggling there? And at one
point, you had talked about maybe having a premium pricing because of the quality
of the performance per watt. Is that something you’re still able to extract? Or is the
focus continue to be more on supply?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to HBM share, I mean, we are extremely focused on achieving our
share to be in line with the industry DRAM share in the second-half of 2025 excited,
as I said, about our product and all the feedback that we have received on that
product, we have highlighted that we have already begun shipments to a second
large HBM customers. And I also said that in CQ1, we will be adding a third large
customer for HBM as well.
So our momentum is continuing to build up in HBM and this is, of course, all again,
built on strong product that has signiﬁcant performance -- and performance per watt
beneﬁts here. And that, of course, helps us with respect to our momentum on the
share, helps us get premium pricing versus others in the marketplace. And we want -
- we plan to absolutely leverage this beyond just 8 High HBM 3E as we move to 12
High in 2025. And of course, beyond 2025, leverage our momentum with product
leadership, with HBM 4 and 4E as well.
I’m not specifying our share at this point for future targets. But of course, we will --
we are extremely focused on continuing to shift the mix of our product portfolio --
overall product portfolio towards higher proﬁt pools of the industry , while remaining
totally disciplined in managing the demand and supply balance and managing our
responsibly managing our investments, capital investments that are related to that as
well.
Joseph Moore
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD
Cowen. Your question please.
Krish Sankar
Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, and sorry to harp on this point
again, Sanjay . Just to clarify , you raised your calendar ‘25 TAM estimate from $25
billion to $30 billion. maintaining our market share, but price and volume is ﬁxed, but
the yields are improving. So simplistically , should we assume three months ago, if
you thought $5.5 billion to $6 billion in HBM revenue exiting second-half of 2025.
That’ s more like $6.5 billion to $7 billion now . Is it the right math to think about for
Micron’ s HBM revenues in sometime in second-half calendar ‘25?
Sanjay Mehrotra
We are not providing speciﬁcs on revenue for HBM. But other than saying that HBM
will be multiple billions of dollars of revenue for us in ‘25. And that we will we are well
on our way to achieving our target of shares to line up with industry DRAM share as
well. I’m not going through the speciﬁcity on our revenue numbers. But again, I can
tell you that this is, of course, a big part of our growth. And we are excited about the
long-term HBM potential as well. W e shared with you that we see HBM becoming a
$100 billion -- more than $100 billion market in 2030 time frame. And with 2020 -- in
2028, HBM being 4 times of what it is in 2024.
And with a strong roadmap of products that is ahead of us, we of course, will capture
the opportunities in this part of the market. And HBM will, given that it is a more
complex product to make, it is a higher cost product. It brings higher value, it brings
higher ASPs. So this positions us very well toward our objective of continuing to shift
towards higher proﬁt pool of the industry .
Krish Sankar
Got it. V ery helpful. And then a quick follow-up, Sanjay . You’re at HBM3E 8 high, so
when you go to 12 high, the trade ratio increases, and you go to HBM4, it’ s also
bigger die size, trade ratio has increased. So as you make these transitions, wouldn’t
it have a negative impact on your gross margin purely because yield will kind of get
reset? Or do you think the transition will be seamless that it should not have any
impact on gross margins?
Sanjay Mehrotra
We have shared before that HBM3E has a trade ratio of approximately 3. And HBM4,
we have said before, will have a higher trade ratio. And of course, these trade ratio
considerations apply to the entire HBM industry . And when we go from 8 high to 12
high you can certainly expect that given the increased complexity of the product, that
will have 12 high will have its own certainly yield ramp, but the learnings of 8 high will
certainly be it beneﬁting us going forward as well.
So -- and our team has done a great job in ramping our products. So I’m pretty sure
that as we go from 85 to 125, our team will do a good job in ramping up the yields on
12 high as well. And all of those factors, of course, play a role in overall objectives
that we have ahead of us. And just keep in mind that the value of HBM absolutely
continues to grow .
As we go from high to 12 high, of course, that gives our customers an opportunity to
attach more content to their GPUs, to their accelerators just by the sheer increase in
the capacity within each [Q] [ph], 50% increase in capacity within each Q. And so
overall, the value of HBM continues to grow as well as we go from 8 high to 12 high
and later on to HBM4 and in the future, with HBM4E having the optionality of
customization as well.
Krish Sankar
Thank you, Sanjay , very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. Your
question, please.
Chris Danely
Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just a bigger question on DRAM. So if supply is going to
equal demand next year and there’ s excess inventory out there, like how is the
market going to do well? And then as a portion of that, you said that high-end DRAM
and HBM or leading-edge DRAM and HBM are doing well. Can you just deﬁne what
leading edge or what percentage of the market that is and what’ s going to happen to
the rest of the market if it remains an oversupply?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So again, yes, leading-edge nodes are in tight supply and not only just HBM, that is
in tight supply . But LP5, DDR5. These are also built in leading-edge nodes and these
are all in tight supply . And we see tight supply for the industry in 2025. As the HBM
requirements increase, that puts even more pressure on non-HBM puts more
pressure on the leading-edge supply . So we see leading-edge outlook remaining
tight and favorable demand supply environment.
And overall DRAM industry , we expect to be healthy . Keep in mind that we have
pointed to not only multiple billions of dollars of revenue in ‘25 with -- in our ﬁscal ‘25
with HBM, but also to multiple billion -- we have pointed to multiple billions of dollars
of revenue with high-density DIMMs and LP5 solutions. And just keep in mind that
those are also very important products for the AI applications.
HBM works closely with LP5 and many accelerator platforms with respect to driving
the full potential of AI. And of course, overall, we see the demand environment
healthy . And vast majority of overall production, as we have already noted in our
prepared remarks, is on leading-edge nodes which are our 1-alpha and 1-beta node
today . And in 2025, we will begin to ramp our 1-gamma node as well.
Mark Murphy
Yes, Chris, I would just add that as you mentioned, inventories at the end of the year
in your question that we currently project our DRAM inventories total to be below our
target levels.
Chris Danely
Got it. Okay . And then just -- and then as a quick follow-up to that. So what gets the
non-leading edge DRAM market healthy again? Because it is still a part of your
business?
Sanjay Mehrotra
No, I mean, of course, our supply is -- mix is, of course, shifting toward more of the
products that are needed in the marketplace, and we are constantly managing our
supply shift. And our production is more towards leading edge while remaining
disciplined with our CapEx and with our supply growth.
Chris Danely
Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. And our ﬁnal question for today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from
Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari
Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two as well. The ﬁrst one is
on China competition. Sanjay , you mentioned LP4 and DDR4 for the rest of the ﬁscal
year is 10% of your business. What are your thoughts on their ability to compete in
DDR5 and LP5, not in the near term, but as you think about the competitive
landscape over the next, call it, 18, 24 months? What are your thoughts? And how do
you intend to respond to that?
Sanjay Mehrotra
So our product mix of LP4 and DDR4, which we have said is about 10% for the
remainder of ﬁscal year ‘25, will, of course, continue to go down in the years ahead
as well. And that just means that the legacy node mix continues to go down in the
years ahead as well. And China competition is more in the lower performance
products. It addresses more the lower end of the consumer market, primarily in
China.
And just keep in mind that the markets are shifting more and more towards higher
performance products and higher performance products, certainly , when you look at
the market moving more to the data center market applications versus just the
consumer and the mix of data center continues to increase, that also requires more
quality requirements. And the platforms continue to move faster toward the
requirements of advanced nodes.
So these are all -- when you look at that, I mean, those that have a long track record
and leading-edge nodes, as well as leading-edge products with strong performance,
low power as well as high-quality then the leaders are better positioned in this
regard. So the competition that we see in China is more on the consumer side of the
business and more on the lower end whereas the market is shifting more and more
towards the requirements of higher end such as in data center . And that’ s where
Micron is focused with our technology and with our advanced product roadmap to
address those parts of the market. And again, that’ s where the higher pool of the
proﬁt of the industry is, and that’ s where we are shifting our mix as well.
Toshiya Hari
Great. And then as my follow-up, you talked about high-capacity enterprise SSDs,
displacing nearline HDDs over the next couple of years. I know this is a view that
you’ve held for a very long time. I’m just curious if you’ve seen anything recently that
would drive an acceleration in that trend? You mentioned NAND front-end cost
downs for you guys in ﬁscal ‘25 being in the low-teens. That seems pretty similar to
what your peers in the drive business are doing so. I’m just curious if anything has
changed recently as you think about that dynamic? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes, of course, we continue to work closely with our customers, and it’ s really about
the total cost of ownership that SSDs provide and SSDs continue to make strong
progress in that regard. It’ s about the performance. It’ s about, of course, power . It’s
about the footprint, all of that, and of course, cost is an important factor there. And all
of that translates into cost of ownership. And we see that in the future, SSDs will
begin to displace HDDs, again, working closely with customers in this regard. And
clearly , AI will continue to be a strong driver in this regard as well. As we saw last
year, I mean, strong demand.
I mean when I say last year , I mean as we saw earlier in this calendar year , there
was a strong demand for our data center SSDs driven by AI. And all of those
requirements of performance, power footprint will absolutely be required in the future
data centers displacing where SSDs will be displacing HDDs. And we look at it as a
phenomenon that is 2027 and beyond.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you.
