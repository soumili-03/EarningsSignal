Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Samir . Good afternoon, everyone.
In ﬁscal Q4, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin above the midpoint of our
guidance, with EPS above the high end of the range. These results reﬂect our strong
execution, and we are well-positioned to drive signiﬁcant improvements in our
ﬁnancial performance.
We believe pricing has now bottomed. Ongoing demand growth, customer inventory
normalization, and industry-wide supply reductions have set the stage for increased
revenue, along with improved pricing and proﬁtability throughout ﬁscal 2024. W e
continue to expect record industry TAM in calendar 2025 with more normalized levels
of proﬁtability .
Fiscal 2023 was a challenging year for the memory and storage industry as the
revenue TAM reached a multiyear low , resulting in a signiﬁcant impact to ﬁnancial
performance. Despite this difﬁcult backdrop, the Micron team stayed focused on our
strategy , executed well and accomplished several important milestones.
We achieved record annual automotive revenue, record NAND QLC bit shipments for
the full ﬁscal year , and reached record levels in calendar Q2 for revenue share in
data center and client SSDs. W e were the ﬁrst in our industry to introduce 1-beta
DDR5 and LP5X DRAM products and the ﬁrst to ship HBM3E samples with industry-
leading performance and power efﬁciency .
We were also the ﬁrst to introduce 232-layer NAND SSD products in data center ,
client and consumer markets. These accomplishments were underpinned by our
leadership technology and continued strong progress in manufacturing execution.
We achieved world-class mature yields in record time on our industry-leading 1-beta
DRAM and 232-layer NAND technologies.
In addition, Micron took several prudent and timely actions to reduce our CapEx and
supply in order to address the market imbalances through the course of ﬁscal 2023.
Our industry-leading technology roadmap continues to progress well. As we have
mentioned before, the vast majority of our bits are on leading-edge nodes 1-alpha
and 1-beta in DRAM and 176-layer and 232-layer in NAND.
We continue to make good progress on 1-gamma DRAM development using EUV
and are on track for production in calendar 2025. Development of our next-
generation NAND node is also well on track.
Now turning to our end markets. Customers continued to reduce their excess
inventory for memory and storage in ﬁscal Q4. Most customer inventories for
memory and storage in the PC and smartphone markets are now at normal levels,
consistent with our prior forecasts. Inventory levels are normal across most
customers in the automotive market as well.
Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize in early
calendar 2024. Consequently , we see demand continuing to strengthen, which has
led to an inﬂection in pricing. Some customers have made strategic purchases in
DRAM and NAND to take advantage of unsustainably low pricing as the market
begins its recovery .
In data center , traditional server demand remains lackluster while demand for AI
servers has been strong. Data center infrastructure operators have shifted budgets
from traditional servers to higher-priced AI servers.
Total server unit shipments are expected to decline in calendar 2023, the ﬁrst year-
over-year decline since 2016. W e expect total server unit growth will resume in
calendar 2024 to help fulﬁll ever-increasing workload demand.
We also expect content growth in both AI and traditional servers. Compared to
traditional servers, AI training servers contain signiﬁcantly higher DRAM and NAND
content with greater technology complexity , robust product value and higher
proﬁtability . We believe our data center revenue has bottomed, and we expect
growth in ﬁscal Q1 and increasing momentum through ﬁscal years '24 and '25 in our
data center business.
Micron has a strengthening portfolio of solutions optimized for bandwidth, capacity
and power . These include HBM3E, DDR5 and associated high-capacity modules,
LPDRAM, and data center SSDs. This portfolio of industry-leading products positions
us well to capture the opportunities presented by data-centric computing
architectures and AI.
The introduction of our HBM3E product of fering has been met with strong customer
interest and enthusiasm. Our HBM3E provides superior bandwidth, power and
capacity for generative AI workloads. W e developed this industry-leading design
using our 1-beta technology , advanced TSV, and other innovations that enable a
differentiated packaging solution.
We have been working closely with our customers throughout the development
process and are becoming a closely integrated partner in their AI roadmaps. Micron
HBM3E is currently in qualiﬁcation for NVIDIA  compute products, which will drive
HBM3E-powered AI solutions. W e expect to begin the production ramp of HBM3E in
early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in ﬁscal 2024.
Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5. W e expect Micron
D5 volume to cross over D4 in early calendar 2024, ahead of the industry . We
expanded our high-capacity D5 DRAM module portfolio with a monolithic die-based
128 gigabyte module, and we have started shipping samples to customers to help
support their AI application needs. W e expect revenue from this product in Q2 of
calendar 2024.
Last month, we announced the introduction of 128 gigabyte and 256 gigabyte CXL
2.0 memory expansion modules. By leveraging a unique dual-channel memory
architecture, we are able to deliver higher module capacity and increased bandwidth.
We have shipped samples to several customers and key partners.
In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio utilizes 176-layer or 232-layer NAND in
production, a testament to our product and technology leadership. W e are well-
positioned to serve the growing demand for fast storage as data-intensive AI
applications proliferate. W e saw strong demand for our data center NVMe SSDs
across our AI-focused, industry-leading 30-terabyte product, as well as for our
mainstream products.
Micron ended the second calendar quarter with record high revenue share in data
center SSDs, based on independent industry assessments. W e expect to build on
this momentum in ﬁscal 2024. In PCs, we continue to forecast calendar 2023 PC unit
volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by
a low to mid-single-digit percentage in calendar 2024. AI-enabled PCs will drive
content growth and an improved refresh cycle over the next two years.
In ﬁscal Q4, we saw strong sequential bit shipment growth at PC OEMs driven by
demand for LPDRAM in thin client notebooks. W e expect to begin revenue
shipments of our industry-leading 1-beta-based client D5 in ﬁscal Q1 to PC OEMs.
According to third-party analysts, in calendar Q2, we reached record revenue share
in client SSDs for PC OEMs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions.
Our 232-layer NVMe client SSD is now qualiﬁed at large OEMs and shipping in
volume production.
Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the second consecutive
quarter , with growth in both client and consumer markets. W e continue to expand our
footprint in the high-end consumer SSD space with the launch of three new products
that extend our reach into professional content creators and enthusiast PC gamers.
In mobile, we expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volume to be down by a mid-
single-digit percentage year-over-year and then grow by a mid-single-digit
percentage in calendar 2024. Elasticity , along with a mix shift toward premium
phones with greater capacity , is contributing to memory content growth. About a third
of smartphones sold today have at least 8 gigabyte of DRAM and 256 gigabyte of
NAND, up more than 7 percentage points versus smartphone units a year ago.
Similar to our view on PCs, AI-enabled mobile phones could drive content growth
and a stronger refresh cycle over time. Longer term, we see generative AI
applications executing on handsets. These applications will continue to drive new
requirements for higher capacity , lower power and increased performance in memory
and storage.
Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which contribute to more stable
revenue and proﬁtability . Fiscal 2023 marked another record revenue year for our
automotive business. Micron continues to lead in automotive market share and
quality .
Long term, we expect memory and storage content per vehicle to increase in both
ADAS and in-cabin applications. In addition, fast-growing EVs typically contain
higher memory and storage content. Our automotive design win trajectory remains
strong.
The industrial market showed signs of recovery in ﬁscal Q4. Inventory levels for
memory and storage are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our
customers. W e expect the volume recovery that we observed in the second half of
ﬁscal 2023 to continue into 2024. W e see strong growth prospects in this market
over time, as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement the IoT , AI and
machine learning solutions.
As previously discussed, the CAC or Cybersecurity Administration of China decision
earlier this year has impacted our business, particularly in the domestic data center
and networking markets in China. W e remain committed to serving our customers in
China for those areas of their business not impacted by the CAC decision. While
there is near-term impact to our demand due to these challenges in China, we
remain focused on maintaining Micron's global market share.
Our team's grit and Micron's deep relationships with our customers, underpinned by
our technology leadership, increasing product momentum, excellent product quality ,
and extensive manufacturing and supply chain capabilities position us well toward
these goals. Now , turning to our market outlook, starting with demand.
We expect calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand to grow in the mid-single-digit
percentage range. In NAND, our expectations for demand growth this calendar year
have increased from high-single digits to high teens percentage. These are below
the expected long-term bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-teens in DRAM and low-
20s percentage range in NAND.
While calendar 2023 DRAM demand has been in line with expectations, NAND
growth expectations have increased due to stronger than expected demand in
certain parts of the consumer market and a trend of greater elasticity in per unit
content.
While macroeconomic factors remain a risk, we expect robust year-over-year bit
demand growth in calendar 2024 for both DRAM and NAND, driven by improving
end-market demand, normalized customer inventory levels, content growth across
products, and ongoing growth in AI. Calendar 2024 bit demand growth is expected to
exceed the long-term CAGR for DRAM and to be near the long-term CAGR for
NAND.
Turning to supply . Signiﬁcant supply and CapEx reductions across the industry have
helped to stabilize the market and are enabling the recovery that is now underway .
We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth in calendar 2023 to be
negative for the industry . We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be
meaningfully negative for DRAM. W e also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in
calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022.
In calendar 2024, we expect industry DRAM and NAND supply growth to be below
industry demand growth and meaningfully so for DRAM. W e believe calendar 2024 is
positioned to be a year of recovery in the memory and storage industry . A sustained
period of supply growth less than demand growth will strengthen the pace of
recovery .
HBM production will be a headwind to industry bit supply growth. Across the industry ,
the HBM3E die is roughly twice the size of equivalent-capacity D5. The HBM product
includes a logic interface die and has a substantially more complex packaging stack
that impacts yields.
As a result, HBM3 and 3E demand will absorb an outsized portion of industry wafer
supply . The ramp of HBM3 and 3E production will reduce overall DRAM bit supply
growth industry-wide with particular supply impact on non-HBM products as more
capacity is diverted to addressing HBM opportunities.
Micron is experiencing a similar impact of our planned HBM3E ramp on our bit
supply capability . Micron's bit supply growth in ﬁscal 2024 is planned to be well below
demand growth for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of
inventory in ﬁscal 2024. W e continue to execute to our strategy of maintaining global
bit shipment market share for DRAM and NAND while sustaining tight supply and
CapEx management discipline.
Micron's ﬁscal 2024 CapEx is projected to be up slightly compared to ﬁscal 2023
levels. WFE CapEx will be down again year-over-year in ﬁscal 2024. W e remain
focused on carefully managing overall supply growth. In last quarter's earnings call,
we communicated that total wafer start reductions in both DRAM and NAND are
approaching 30% versus peak 2022 levels. Amid an intense focus on capital
efﬁciency over the last few quarters, we have redeployed a portion of the
underutilized equipment to support production ramp of leading-edge nodes in both
DRAM and NAND.
Given the higher process step count of these leading-edge nodes, transitioning this
equipment results in a signiﬁcant and structural reduction to our overall wafer
capacity in both DRAM and NAND. Due to this structural reduction in capacity , our
DRAM and NAND wafer starts will remain signiﬁcantly below 2022 levels for the
foreseeable future.
Our industry supply projections assume a similar structural reduction in wafer
capacity industrywide. Lead times to increase this wafer capacity will be long and will
depend on improving demand, pricing and ﬁnancial performance. W e expect
underutilization to continue in our legacy nodes well into calendar 2024. W e see our
demand at leading-edge nodes exceeding our supply in ﬁscal and calendar 2024,
particularly in the second half of the year .
Construction CapEx will be elevated to support our plans to build leading-edge
memory fabs in Idaho and New York, for which we ﬁled CHIPS applications in
August. As we have highlighted before, the requested level of CHIPS grants for our
Idaho and New York projects are essential to the viability and global competitiveness
of each of these projects. Our CapEx plans assume that a certain level of CHIPS
grant funds will be made available to us in ﬁscal year 2024.
Assembly and Test CapEx is projected to double year-over-year in ﬁscal 2024,
predominantly driven by investments to support HBM3E production. Our planned
ﬁscal 2024 CapEx investments in HBM capacity have substantially increased versus
our prior plan in response to strong customer demand for our industry-leading
product.
Over the course of calendar 2024, we see accelerating AI-driven opportunities for
memory and storage across multiple market segments from the data center to the
edge. W e are encouraged by the improving industry demand and supply
fundamentals.
We believe that the CapEx constraints created by the industry proﬁtability
environment, coupled with improved inventories, announced supply reductions and
the impact of the HBM ramp on DRAM bit supply growth will create conditions that
will increasingly tighten the supply-demand balance, particularly in the second half of
our ﬁscal year .
Our Micron team is executing well and they are taking prudent and proactive actions
to navigate through the near-term environment and position the company to emerge
stronger from the current downturn. W e look forward to a recovery in our business
ﬁnancials taking shape in ﬁscal 2024.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone.
In the fourth quarter of ﬁscal 2023, Micron delivered revenue and gross margin
higher than the midpoint of the guidance range and EPS above the high end of the
range. W e are exiting the ﬁscal year with the business improving due to multiple
factors including higher volumes, an inﬂection in the pricing environment, strong
productivity and ongoing capital discipline.
Total ﬁscal Q4 revenue was approximately $4 billion, up 7% sequentially and down
40% year-over-year . Fiscal 2023 total revenue was $15.5 billion, down 49% year-
over-year . Fiscal Q4 DRAM revenue was $2.8 billion, representing 69% of total
revenue.
DRAM revenue increased 3% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing in the mid-
teens percentage range and prices declining in the high-single-digit percentage
range. For the ﬁscal year , DRAM revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $1 1 billion,
representing 71% of total revenue.
Fiscal Q4 NAND revenue was $1.2 billion, representing around 30% of Micron's total
revenue. NAND revenue increased 19% sequentially , with bit shipments increasing
over 40% driven by timing of shipments including strategic purchases and prices
declining in the mid-teens percentage range. For the ﬁscal year , NAND revenue
declined 46% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, representing 27% of total revenue.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $1.2 billion, down 14% sequentially . Data center revenue remained
weak as customers continued to adjust inventories and as a result of the CAC
decision. In ﬁscal Q1, we expect sequential growth in data center .
Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit was $1.2 billion, up 48% sequentially due to
seasonal ef fects and timing of shipments. Embedded Business Unit revenue was
$860 million, down 6% sequentially . Embedded Consumer revenue increased
sequentially , helped by seasonality while automotive and industrial revenue declined
modestly .
Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $739 million, up 18% sequentially and
driven by increased shipments across most of the product portfolio. SBU bit
shipments set records for ﬁscal Q4 and the ﬁscal year .
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q4 was negative 9%, improving seven
percentage points sequentially . Gross margin was impacted by lower pricing and
underutilization costs, while the sell through of previously written-down inventory
provided some uplift.
For the ﬁscal year , consolidated gross margin was negative 8%, down 54 percentage
points year-over-year driven by price ef fects, inventory write-downs and the burden
of underutilization. Approximately six percentage points of the reduction is from net
inventory write-downs.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q4 were $842 million, down $24 million sequentially
due to ongoing expense-reduction initiatives and the timing of certain R&D program
expenditures. For the ﬁscal year , operating expenses were $3.6 billion, down $209
million year-over-year driven by expense-reduction initiatives.
On OpEx for the fourth quarter and year , we ended below the target we
communicated starting with our September call a year ago. As market conditions
improve, we will remain disciplined in all spending, including operating expenses,
focusing R&D on the most critical programs and leveraging a competitive and more
productive overhead structure.
We had an operating loss of roughly $1.2 billion in ﬁscal Q4, resulting in an operating
margin of negative 30%, improved from negative 39% in the prior quarter . Fiscal
2023 operating loss was $4.8 billion, resulting in an operating margin of negative
31%.
We recorded a tax beneﬁt of $14 million in ﬁscal Q4, better than expectations and
due primarily to lower than expected foreign taxes related to currency ef fects. For
ﬁscal 2023, total taxes were $142 million.
The non-GAAP  loss per share in ﬁscal Q4 was $1.07, compared to a loss per share
of $1.43 in the prior quarter and earnings per share of $1.45 in the year-ago quarter .
Non-GAAP  EPS was a loss per share of $4.45 for the ﬁscal year .
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending. Our operating cash ﬂows were
approximately $250 million in ﬁscal Q4. For the ﬁscal year , we generated $1.6 billion
of cash from operations representing 10% of revenue. Capital expenditures were $1
billion during the quarter and totaled $7 billion for the ﬁscal year . This was in line with
recent guidance, and for the year , at the low end of the range of estimates we
provided on our December 2022 earnings call. Free cash ﬂow was negative $758
million in the quarter .
Our ﬁscal Q4 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 170 days. As mentioned last
quarter , we are holding approximately $1 billion of strategic inventory stock
associated with build ahead of products for cost optimization and risk mitigation. W e
see days of inventory improving into the ﬁrst half of the ﬁscal year and, adjusting for
this strategic stock, expect to have only a few weeks of above target inventories as
we enter the second half of ﬁscal 2024. Inventory levels and proﬁtability will remain
principal factors in our decisions around wafer starts and capacity planning.
Continuing with the balance sheet, we maintained historically high levels of liquidity .
At year-end, we held $10.5 billion of cash and investments and had $13 billion of
liquidity when including our untapped credit facility . We ended the year with $13.3
billion in total debt, a weighted average maturity of 2030 on debt, and low net
leverage.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal ﬁrst quarter . Demand is improving as
customer inventory levels continue to normalize and secular growth drivers remain
intact. W e expect record DRAM bit shipments in ﬁscal Q1. For NAND, we expect
ﬁscal Q1 bit shipments to decline somewhat from ﬁscal Q4 levels but remain
relatively strong.
In China, the Cyberspace Administration of China decision continues to impact our
revenue opportunity , and the associated headwind is reﬂected in our guidance.
Fiscal Q1 gross margin is projected to improve sequentially on a greater mix of
DRAM and more sell-through of written-down inventories. W e expect approximately
60% of the remaining beneﬁt from lower cost inventories to clear in ﬁscal Q1. Our
gross margin guidance does not contemplate any additional inventory write-downs
due to pricing.
Period costs associated with underutilization will weigh on gross margins in the
quarter , as ﬁrst quarter period costs are projected to be similar to the prior quarter .
Beyond ﬁscal Q1, we project gross margin improvement to continue as prices
increase and period costs become less of a factor . We expect the rate of price
improvement in the second ﬁscal half to exceed the ﬁrst half.
We now forecast gross margins to be positive throughout the second half of ﬁscal
2024. As mentioned last quarter , we expect ﬁscal Q1 operating expenses to increase
sequentially , driven by an increase in R&D and as temporary reductions to employee
compensation come to an end. For the full ﬁscal year 2024, we expect operating
expenses to be up by a low-single-digit percentage versus ﬁscal 2023.
On taxes, we project a material sequential quarterly increase as we move from a
credit in Q4 to a more normal expense. As discussed previously , though overall
proﬁtability remains low , a minimum level of taxes will occur based primarily on local
jurisdiction proﬁt. As we are forecasting a consolidated pretax loss in ﬁscal 2024,
these local factors will drive tax expense again this year .
We estimate our full-year ﬁscal 2024 taxes to be under $200 million. A ﬁrst quarter
tax estimate of $80 million reﬂects our forecasted Q1 results in proportion to full-year
projected tax expense. Changes in the distribution of proﬁt within the year may result
in changes in the tax expense recognized each quarter .
We project our ﬁscal 2024 capital expenditures to increase slightly versus ﬁscal 2023
as we balance the long-term capacity needs of the business with ongoing capital
discipline and near-term cash ﬂow objectives. Consistent with our comments the last
few quarters, we do see WFE CapEx decreasing from ﬁscal 2023 to ﬁscal 2024.
When factoring higher construction spend and expected grants in ﬁscal 2024, we
forecast our CapEx to be more evenly distributed over ﬁscal 2024.
A sequential increase in quarterly CapEx, together with improving but still challenging
proﬁtability levels in the near term, means free cash ﬂow will remain signiﬁcantly
negative in the ﬁrst half of the ﬁscal year . We forecast improved free cash ﬂow in the
back half of the ﬁscal year .
We project our balance sheet to remain strong and net leverage ratio to peak in the
second quarter of ﬁscal 2024. To support the long-term investment priorities of the
business, we have ample liquidity and ready access to multiple sources of credit. W e
will continue to manage our business to maintain ﬁnancial ﬂexibility and in a manner
consistent with our commitment to our investment-grade rating.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q1 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $4.4 billion, plus or minus $200 million. Gross margin to be in
the range of negative 4%, plus or minus 200 basis points. And operating expenses to
be approximately $900 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax expense of
approximately $80 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion
shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.07, plus or minus $0.07.
In closing, we achieved many successes in ﬁscal 2023 despite facing a historic
downturn. W e sustained our technology , product and manufacturing leadership and
achieved mature yields in record time on the industry's most advanced nodes in
DRAM and NAND. Micron's leading product announcements position us well to
address the growing performance requirements of data-centric computing.
In response to severe market conditions, we acted quickly and decisively to cut
supply and capital spend, to reduce operating costs and improve productivity , and to
maintain a solid and ﬂexible balance sheet. As the business improves in ﬁscal 2024,
we will leverage our strengths in technology , product and manufacturing while
maintaining the productivity and capital discipline that we displayed in ﬁscal 2023.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark.
The past four quarters tested the resilience and agility of our entire industry . While
the recovery from this downturn has begun, Micron will exercise continued supply
discipline to drive a return to sustained proﬁtability . I am proud of our team's
response to adversity , sustaining our technology leadership, improving time to
mature yield, and launching a suite of leading-edge products that represent one of
the strongest portfolio expansions in Micron's 45-year history .
As our global investment announcements throughout the year clearly show , Micron
remains keenly focused on building our business to meet future demand driven by
the proliferation of AI from the data center to the edge. I have full conﬁdence in our
team, the position we have built for Micron, and our collective ability to capitalize on
the opportunities ahead.
Thank you for joining us today . We will now open up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our ﬁrst question for today comes from the line Tom
O'Malley from Barclays. Your question, please.
Tom O'Malley
Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just want to understand the trajectory here
on the NAND business. You guys in the quarter kind of took your demand proﬁle
from high-single-digits to high teens and you pointed out consumer in particular .
What can you do to give us conﬁdence that, that wasn't a pull in from some of your
large consumer customers, and that later this year there might be a little hole there,
and just talk about the trajectory of where you see that business going, just given you
said that bits are going to be down sequentially into November? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to NAND, yes, I mean compared to what we have said before, we
saw strong demand, particularly on the consumer , including some parts of the
channel and the consumer part included likes of smartphones, PCs, et cetera, and
again, as I pointed out, the channel as well. And keep in mind, with the pricing that
has existed for NAND, elasticity has certainly kicked in. The content is continuing to
increase in the devices.
Today , ﬂagship smartphones have minimum of 8 gigabyte DRAM and 128 gigabyte
of NAND. So that's the overall trend and same thing in PCs that the elasticity is
driving, increasing average capacities. And overall certainly strategic vibe have
inﬂuenced some of the NAND demand for the year as well.
And keep in mind that next year in 2024, we see that the demand growth will be
pretty much close to the long-term CAGR for NAND. And the strat buyers - the
strategic buyers that I mentioned, of course, they help improve the inventory position
for NAND as well.
So overall, of course, supply cuts have been made in NAND as well. And as we look
ahead, we do see that the demand and supply fundamentals will continue to improve
on the NAND side as well.
Tom O'Malley
Very helpful.
Sanjay Mehrotra
And the inﬂection in pricing as well has occurred and, you know , particularly in the
second half of our ﬁscal year we would see that continued improvement in the pricing
as well.
Tom O'Malley
Helpful. And then just as a follow-up, obviously you're facing headwinds from the
CAC band. Can you just talk about areas of the market where you guys are targeting
to help make up some of those bits. Is it just conversations with customers in the
consumer space or are you looking at content increases in the data center , just given
the puts and takes of you know where you're making up that a double-digit
percentage hole and if you see kind of any change to that. Is it getting worse or is it
getting better into February and May of this year? Thank you very much.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So as we have mentioned before, the CAC headwinds are primarily in the data
center and networking markets for us in China. And the impact, the negative impact
of revenue as a result of CAC decision is already baked in in our CQ4 results, and is
also included in our FQ1 guidance here.
And keep in minds that the CAC decision, I mean, continues to remain a risk for our
business and the impact in our China demand is meaningful. However , Micron has
made strong progress with respect to mitigating the ef fects as well with our global
customers who are not impacted by the CAC decision. And we are mitigating that
and ef fect of the mitigation also is reﬂected in our FQ4 results, as well as in FQ1
guidance.
So the - FQ4 results and FQ1 guidance reﬂect the net ef fect of the loss of revenue in
China as well as the success with some of the mitigation, and of course, we are
working on mitigating the China revenue loss with increases in demand for us across
our multiple end-markets, across all our global end-markets.
And remember that our goal remains to maintain our global share. While there may
be some ebbs and ﬂows in the near term, But you know our goal absolutely remains
to maintain our global market share here in terms of bits.

Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari
Hi guys, thank you for the question. I had a gross margin question for you, Mark.
You're guiding November quarter up ﬁve percentage points sequentially . I was
hoping you could provide a bridge, if you will, on a sequential basis. You talked a little
bit about you know period costs continuing to be a headwind. You gave a little bit of
color for the beneﬁt you'll see from selling through written-down inventory . But, you
know what are your thoughts on pricing. What are your thoughts on cost-downs? And
if you can give you know directional guidance for FED and the puts and takes there,
that would be helpful as well. Thank you.
Mark Murphy
Sure, Toshi. I am - so on the fourth to ﬁrst quarter bridge, as you mentioned, we are
forecasting roughly a 500 basis-point improvement. W e did say over the last few
quarters that this would be the proﬁle of our improvement. I will say that it's gotten
incrementally better . And that we said before that our proﬁle would be that we would
be positive gross margin in the fourth quarter of ﬁscal '24. W e now believe will be
positive gross margin through ﬁscal '24 and so you'll see this positive margin trend
continuing.
As it relates to the ﬁrst quarter , we do get a small beneﬁt roughly , you know , roughly
a point of incremental low-cost inventory pass-through from what passes through in
the ﬁrst quarter , which will be around $600 million versus what we had pass-through
in the fourth quarter , which is roughly $550 million.
We also will see a slight beneﬁt in price indeed in the ﬁrst quarter . As we've
mentioned in the last several quarters, we ﬁrst saw pockets of improvement. And
then, we mention that prices bottoming. W e are mentioning on this call that it has
bottomed and we are seeing in the ﬁrst quarter price improvement and we expect
that in this transition period to be somewhat muted in the ﬁrst half and then pick-up
momentum and strengthen considerably in the second half.
So that's the, you know , general walk for the ﬁrst quarter . I will, because there's a lot
of puts and takes, maybe just, it's been a very difﬁcult several quarters around both
utilization write-downs. And fortunately , we're on the other side of that which we can
cover later in this call or the after call.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you. And then maybe as a quick follow-up on HBM for Sanjay . You know ,
three months ago, you guys talked about or at least hinted that in ﬁscal '24, you
might be able to generate you know several $100 million in revenue. Is that sort of
target still intact? Have things improved since then and I guess at what point do you
expect your presence in HBM to be similar to your presence in DRAM overall? Thank
you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
We are very excited with our HBM product. It is an industry-leading product with
respect to performance, power , capacity , capability . And as we have mentioned, this
product is in the qualiﬁcation stages with our customers here and we expect revenue
to begin in early 2024. And yes, we are very much still on track for meaningful
revenue, several hundred million dollars in our ﬁscal year '24.
So pleased with the progress, continuing to make good progress. It is an exciting
opportunity for the memory industry and Micron will be well-positioned to capture the
generative AI opportunities that require the kind of attributes that our HBM3E
memory brings to the market. And, of course, as we proceed through the ﬁscal year ,
we expect to be gaining share in this important part of the high - in this important
high growth part of the memory market.
Toshiya Hari
Thanks so much.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question, please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot, Mark, I wanted to clarify the statement on gross margin. So, you had
said in the prepared remarks that it would be positive in the back half of the ﬁscal
year. But in response to the question just before, you said that it will be positive
through ﬁscal '24. So since you're guiding negative in ﬁscal Q1, does that tell us that
ﬁscal Q2 gross margin will be positive?
Mark Murphy
Good question, Tim. I didn't comment on ﬁscal Q2. I - ﬁscal Q3, we believe, will be
positive. And there'll be a trend of improving gross margin ﬁscal Q1 through ﬁscal
Q3.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay . So you don't want to state that ﬁscal Q2 will be positive, maybe it will be,
maybe it won't.
Mark Murphy
It - maybe. It depends on of course pricing and we're continuing to drive productivity
and we'll just have to see at these proﬁtability levels, mix and other things matter . I
mean, we do have favorable mix of DRAM going into the ﬁrst half. You know , we're
increasing DRAM relative to NAND in the ﬁrst half of the year . So that helps.
You know , we, pricing, the momentum is deﬁnitively positive. It's just a case of you
know we're in a transition period, we did see you know , we kind of had to meet the
market on some special deals here in the fourth quarter and you know those ef fects
will continue in the ﬁrst half, but you know we're deﬁnitely seeing new deals being
struck at higher prices and we certainly expect that to strengthen in the second-half.
Timothy Arcuri
Got it, thanks. And then as a follow-up, just on that comment you just made about
called special deals and - that you, you know , struck in, you know , ﬁscal Q4. NAND
demand, you're more positive on NAND demand, but pricing was still as bad if not
worse than at least I thought it would have been in - you know , side of ﬁscal Q4. So
is - can you kind of foot that, is that maybe you of fering some big deals on the NAND
side, some you know customers coming in and being opportunistic and you of ferings
some big deals to move bits and maybe shore up your NAND share, but at the
expense of price. Can you just walk through that force? Thanks.
Mark Murphy
Yes. I would say , Tim, that, you know , really NAND pricing was not - was basically in
line with the downs that we saw in the third quarter . So, I would say that prices - the
decrease had slowed and the price or the market was being the ﬁrm of f. You know
that - you know customers realize that this is a period that's ending, the markets
ﬁrming up, you know , and so, you know , there is also some mix ef fects in there.
We do see price and NAND improving in the ﬁrst quarter . It will be up actually in the
ﬁrst quarter . And so I think that's all, I'd say , on price for NAND.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the
line of Mehdi Hosseini from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your question, please.
Mehdi Hosseini
Yes, sir . Thank you for taking my question. Two follow-ups. I would like to better
understand the dynamics of seasonality . You talked about the NAND bit shipment
declining in the Q1 ﬁscal year and most of the growth coming from DRAM, but how
should we think about seasonality impact in February quarter? And I have a follow-
up.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So certainly , the typical seasonality will be in place. But just keep in mind that FQ4,
we had a very strong sequential bit growth in the NAND business. And - I mean
coming of f that big sequential growth, we are just guiding to you know normalized
level of overall shipments as part of FQ1 and overall, you know - and again, the
content continues to increase across the end-market applications. And that will
continue to drive increased demand growth for us as well.
Mehdi Hosseini
But would there be seasonality in February quarter?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, typical seasonality trends that exist in the consumer market would be there. But
keep in mind that you know it all depends on the mix of the business as well for us.
In terms of NAND, you know , in - it - maybe I have already guided to the trends.
But overall when we look at the full-year basis, we would look at you know that
calendar year '24, NAND will be growing in line with the long-term CAGR or near the
long-term CAGR and DRAM will be growing in terms of demand much ahead of the
long-term CAGR as well and all of that will of course take into account the typical
seasonality that occurs in the industry .
Mehdi Hosseini
Great, thanks for detail. And second question has to do with the puts and takes in
reducing wafer starts. And I understand that more emphasis is on the trade mix. But
as you - as I think about memory like, there is no trailing edge. And in that context as
you think about bringing utilization rate back up to the normal level. and some of the
trailing edge converted to the leading edge, could that help with a bigger step-up in
gross margin improvement? How should we think about it, assuming that the trailing
edge would be phased out?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, good question and I think I would like to take the opportunity to provide some
context here and overall background. As you know that in 2023, the industry has
experienced extreme over supply and you know extreme negative ef fect on the
proﬁtability as well. And you see now that CapEx cuts and underutilization in the fab
have been implemented across the industry given the CapEx constraints that we
have, as well as given the poor proﬁtability and certainly Micron has done that, but
this is happening across the industry as well.
And at the same time, the demand for the new products is increasing that requires,
you know , as you were pointing out, leading edge technology as well. And in order to
maintain our supply discipline and to meet the demand for these new products such
as HBM, such as DDR5, we are shifting some of our equipment from older nodes
into the newer technologies to ramp up those newer technologies into production.
In the past, we would have done this with more CapEx. But we are being extremely
mindful of CapEx spend, extremely disciplined about supply . So as a result, when we
move the equipment from older nodes to support the ramp-up of leading-edge
nodes, it results in a net reduction in overall - in a net reduction and the structural
reduction in the wafer capacity as well. And that overall bodes well for the industry
demand-supply fundamentals.
So keep in mind that as we go through the year , we - and you know , as we shift more
of the equipment toward ramp up of leading edge nodes, this will result in overall
wafer capacity reduction and lowering underutilization as well. Of course, the legacy
nodes will continue to have underutilization through the course of the year . And these
are all helpful factors in terms of the demand-supply balance in the industry .
And you know , some of the phenomena that we have described regarding structural
wafer capacity reduction, this is not unique to Micron. W e believe this is happening
with other suppliers as well as they grapple with the same supply proﬁtability and
CapEx considerations as we are adjusting.
So the reduction in wafer capacity is actually the headwind and supply growth. And
this you know that increasing wafer capacity has a high bar for auto - for CapEx
investments, it has a high bar in terms of ROI, and of course, it would require longer
lead-time as well given the new equipment that would be required. So reduction -
structural reduction in wafer capacity is overall good coupled where the
underutilization in the legacy nodes.
And as we pointed out, the new products in the leading-edge nodes also do require
more wafer capacity for the same gigabits of production given the nature of like HBM
that - where the die-size is twice as big. So, these new products also actually have a
favorable impact on the industry supply growth capability .
And these trends of supply growth with respect to structural wafer capacity-reduction
and the new products that end up requiring more new wafer capacity are extremely
important factors in terms of really understanding the improving, strengthening
demand-supply fundamentals as we look at our ﬁscal year '24 and calendar year
2024.
