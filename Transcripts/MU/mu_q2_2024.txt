Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Satya. Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report that Micron
delivered ﬁscal Q2 revenue, gross margin, and EPS well above the high end of
guidance. Micron has returned to proﬁtability and delivered positive operating margin
a quarter ahead of expectation. I would like to thank all our Micron global team
members for their dedication and excellent execution that made this result possible.
Micron drove robust price increases as the supply-demand balance tightened. This
improvement in market conditions was due to a conﬂuence of factors, including
strong AI server demand, a healthier demand environment in most end markets, and
supply reductions across the industry . AI server demand is driving rapid growth in
HBM, DDR5, and data center SSDs, which is tightening leading-edge supply
availability for DRAM and NAND.
This is resulting in a positive ripple ef fect on pricing across all memory and storage
end markets. W e expect DRAM and NAND pricing levels to increase further
throughout calendar year 2024 and expect record revenue and much improved
proﬁtability now in ﬁscal year 2025.
Micron is at the forefront of ramping the industry's most advanced technology nodes
in both DRAM and NAND. Reinforcing our leadership position, over three-quarters of
our DRAM bits are now on leading-edge 1-alpha and 1-beta nodes, and over 90% of
our NAND bits are on 176-layer and 232-layer nodes. W e expect ﬁscal 2024 front-
end cost reductions, excluding the impact of HBM, to track in line with our long-term
expectations of mid to high single digits in DRAM and low teens in NAND, supported
by the continued volume ramp of 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND.
We continue to mature our production capability with extreme ultraviolet lithography
and have achieved equivalent yield and quality on our 1-alpha as well as 1-beta
nodes between EUV and non-EUV ﬂows. W e have begun 1-gamma DRAM pilot
production using EUV and are on track for volume production in calendar 2025. The
development of our next-generation NAND node is on track, with volume production
planned for calendar 2025. W e expect to maintain our technology leadership in
NAND.
Now turning to our end markets. Inventories for memory and storage have improved
signiﬁcantly in the data center , and we continue to expect normalization in the ﬁrst
half of calendar 2024. In PC and smartphone, there were some strategic purchases
in calendar Q4 in anticipation of a return to unit growth. Inventories remain near
normal levels for auto, industrial, and other markets.
We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this
disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society . The race is
on to create artiﬁcial general intelligence, or AGI, which will require ever-increasing
model sizes with trillions of parameters.
On the other end of the spectrum, there is considerable progress being made on
improving AI models, so that they can run on edge devices, like PCs and
smartphones, and create new and compelling capabilities. As AI training workloads
remain a driver of technology and innovation, inference growth is also rapidly
accelerating.
Memory and storage technologies are key enablers of AI in both training and
inference workloads, and Micron is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends in
both the data center and the edge. W e view Micron as one of the biggest
beneﬁciaries in the semiconductor industry of this multiyear growth opportunity
driven by AI.
In data center , total industry server unit shipments are expected to grow mid to high
single digits in calendar 2024, driven by strong growth for AI servers and a return to
modest growth for traditional servers. Micron is well positioned with our portfolio of
HBM, D5, LP5, high-capacity DIMM, CXL, and data center SSD products.
Delivering improved memory bandwidth, power consumption, and overall
performance is critical to enable cost-efﬁcient scaling of AI workloads inside modern
GPU or ASIC-accelerated AI servers. Our customers are driving an aggressive AI
roadmap on their GPU and ASIC-based server platforms that require signiﬁcantly
higher content and higher-performance memory and storage solutions.
For example, earlier this week, Nvidia announced its next-generation Blackwell GPU
architecture-based AI systems, which provides a 33% increase in the HBM3E
content, continuing a trend of steadily increasing HBM content per GPU. Micron's
industry-leading high-bandwidth memory HBM3E solution provides more than 20
times the memory bandwidth compared to standard D5-based DIMM server module.
We are executing well on our HBM product ramp plans and have made signiﬁcant
progress in ramping our capacity , yields, and quality . We commenced volume
production and recognized our ﬁrst revenue from HBM3E in ﬁscal Q2 and now have
begun high-volume shipments of our HBM3E product.
Customers continue to give strong feedback that our HBM3E solution has a 30%
lower power consumption compared to competitors' solutions. This beneﬁt is
contributing to strong demand. Our HBM3E product will be a part of Nvidia's H200
Tensor Core GPUs, and we are making progress on additional platform qualiﬁcations
with multiple customers.
We are on track to generate several hundred million dollars of revenue from HBM in
ﬁscal 2024 and expect HBM revenues to be accretive to our DRAM and overall gross
margins starting in the ﬁscal third quarter . Our HBM is sold out for calendar 2024,
and the overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.
We continue to expect HBM bit share equivalent to our overall DRAM bit share some
time in calendar 2025. Earlier this month, we sampled our 12-high HBM3E product,
which provides 50% increased capacity of DRAM per cube to 36 gigabyte. This
increase in capacity allows our customers to pack more memory per GPU, enabling
more powerful AI training and inference solutions.
We expect 12-high HBM3E will start ramping in high-volume production and increase
in mix throughout 2025. W e have a robust roadmap and we are conﬁdent we will
maintain our technology leadership with HBM4, the next generation of HBM, which
will provide further performance and capacity enhancements compared to HBM3E.
We are making strong progress on our suite of high-capacity server DIMM products.
During the quarter , we completed validation of the industry's ﬁrst mono-die-based
128 gigabyte server DRAM module. This new product provides the industry's
highest-bandwidth D5 capability , with greater than 20% better energy efﬁciency and
over 15% improved latency performance compared to competitors' 3D TSV-based
solutions.
We see strong customer pull and expect a robust volume ramp for our 128 gigabyte
product, with several hundred million dollars of revenue in the second half of ﬁscal
2024. Additionally , we also started sampling our 256 gigabyte MCRDIMM module,
which further enhances performance and increases DRAM content per server .
We achieved record revenue share in the data center SSD market in calendar 2023.
During the quarter , we grew our revenue by over 50% sequentially for our 232-layer-
based 6500 30 terabytes SSDs, which of fer best-in-class performance, reliability , and
endurance for AI data lake applications.
In PC, after two years of double-digit declines, unit volumes are expected to grow
modestly in the low single-digit range for calendar 2024. W e are encouraged by the
strong ecosystem momentum to develop next-generation AI PCs, which feature high-
performance Neural Processing Unit chipsets and 40% to 80% more DRAM content
versus today's average PCs. W e expect next-generation AI PC units to grow and
become a meaningful portion of total PC units in calendar 2025.
At CES, the consumer electronics show in Las V egas, Micron launched the industry's
ﬁrst low-power compression-attached memory module, or LPCAMM2, for PC
applications. LPCAMM2 brings a modular form factor , with a maximum capacity point
of 64 gigabyte for PC module and 128 gigabyte for server module, along with a
number of beneﬁts such as higher bandwidth, lower power , and smaller form factor .
During the quarter , we launched our 232-layer-based Crucial T705 Gen 5 consumer
SSD, which won several editor choice awards and was recognized by a leading
publisher as the fastest M.2 SSD ever . We increased our client SSD QLC bit
shipments to record levels, with QLC representing nearly two-thirds of our client SSD
shipments, ﬁrmly establishing Micron as the leader in client QLC SSDs.
Turning to mobile. Smartphone unit volumes in calendar 2024 remain on track to
grow low to mid-single digits. Smartphones of fer tremendous potential for
personalized AI capabilities that of fer greater security and responsiveness when
executed on device. Enabling these on-device AI capabilities is driving increased
memory and storage capacity needs and increasing demand for new value-add
solutions. For example, we expect AI phones to carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM
content compared to non-AI ﬂagship phones today .
Micron's leading mobile solutions provide the critical high performance and power
efﬁciency needed to unlock an unprecedented level of AI capability . In DRAM, we are
now sampling our second-generation, 1-beta LPDRAM LP5X product, which delivers
the industry's highest performance at improved power for ﬂagship smartphones.
And in NAND, we announced our second generation of 232-layer NAND UFS 4.0
devices, featuring the industry's smallest package and breakthrough features that
enable greater reliability and signiﬁcantly higher real-world performance for complex
workloads.
Our mobile DRAM and NAND solutions are now widely adopted in industry-leading
ﬂagship smartphones, with two examples being Samsung's Galaxy S24 and the
Honor Magic 6 Pro announced this year . The Samsung Galaxy S24 can provide two-
way, real-time voice and text translations during live phone calls. The Honor Magic 6
Pro features the Magic LM, a seven-billion parameter large language model, which
can intelligently understand a user's intent based on language, image, eye
movement, and gestures and proactively of fer services to enhance and simplify the
user experience.
Turning to auto and industrial. The automotive sector continues to experience robust
demand for memory and storage as non-memory semiconductor supply constraints
have eased and as new vehicle platforms are launched. In the past quarter , we
experienced strong growth with partners who are driving the most advanced
capabilities within the automobile's increasingly intelligent and connected digital
cockpits. In addition, adoption of Level 2+ ADAS capabilities continues to gain
momentum, further expanding content per vehicle.
The industrial market fundamentals for memory are also healthy , with improving
distributor inventory , book-to-bill, and demand visibility improvements, as well as
pricing beneﬁts from the tight supply for products, especially those built on leading-
edge nodes.
Now, turning to our market outlook. Calendar 2023 DRAM bit demand growth was in
the low double-digit percentage range, and NAND bit demand growth was in the low-
20s percentage range, both a few percentage points higher than previous
expectations. W e forecast calendar 2024 bit demand growth for the industry to be
near the long-term CAGR for DRAM and around the mid-teens for NAND.
Given the higher baseline of 2023 demand, these expectations of 2024 bit growth
have driven an increase in the absolute level of 2024 bit demand in our model for
DRAM and NAND versus our prior expectations. The industry supply-demand
balance is tight for DRAM and NAND, and our outlook for pricing has increased for
calendar 2024. Over the medium term, we expect bit demand growth CAGRs of mid-
teens in DRAM and low-20s percentage range in NAND.
Turning to supply . The supply outlook remains roughly the same as last quarter . We
expect calendar 2024 industry supply to be below demand for both DRAM and
NAND. Micron's bit supply growth in ﬁscal 2024 remains below our demand growth
for both DRAM and NAND, and we expect to decrease our days of inventory in ﬁscal
year 2024.
Micron's ﬁscal 2024 CapEx plan remains unchanged at a range between $7.5 billion
and $8.0 billion. W e continue to project our WFE spending will be down year-on-year
in ﬁscal 2024. Micron's capital-efﬁcient approach to reuse equipment from older
nodes to support conversions to leading-edge nodes has resulted in a material
structural reduction of our DRAM and NAND wafer capacities.
We are now fully utilized on our high-volume manufacturing nodes and are
maximizing output against the structurally lowered capacity . We believe this
approach to node migration and consequent wafer capacity reduction is an industry-
wide phenomenon. W e project to end ﬁscal 2024 with low double-digit percentage
less wafer capacity in both DRAM and NAND than our peak levels in ﬁscal 2022.
Signiﬁcant supply reductions across the industry have enabled the pricing recovery
that is now underway . Although our ﬁnancial performance has improved, our current
proﬁtability levels are still well below our long-term targets, and signiﬁcantly improved
proﬁtability is required to support the R&D and CapEx investments needed for long-
term innovation and supply growth. Micron will continue to exercise supply and
CapEx discipline and focus on restoring improved proﬁtability while maintaining our
bit market share for DRAM and NAND.
As discussed previously , the ramp of HBM production will constrain supply growth in
non-HBM products. Industrywide, HBM3E consumes approximately three times the
wafer supply as D5 to produce a given number of bits in the same technology node.
With increased performance and packaging complexity , across the industry , we
expect the trade ratio for HBM4 to be even higher than the trade ratio for HBM3E.
We anticipate strong HBM demand due to AI, combined with increasing silicon
intensity of the HBM roadmap, to contribute to tight supply conditions for DRAM
across all the end markets.
Finally , as we consider these demand and technology trends, we are carefully
planning our global fab and assembly/test capacity requirements to ensure a
diversiﬁed and cost-competitive manufacturing footprint. Announced projects in
China, India, and Japan are proceeding as planned.
On potential U.S. expansion plans, we have assumed CHIPS grants in our CapEx
plans for ﬁscal 2024. Our planned Idaho and New York projects require Micron to
receive the combination of sufﬁcient CHIPS grants, investment tax credits, and local
incentives to address the cost dif ference compared to overseas expansion.
I will now turn it over to Mark for our ﬁnancial results and outlook.
Mark Murphy
Thanks, Sanjay , and good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered strong results in
ﬁscal Q2 with revenue, gross margin, and EPS well above the high end of the
guidance ranges provided in our last earnings call. Much improved market
conditions, along with the team's excellent execution on pricing, products, and
operations, drove the strong ﬁnancial results.
Total ﬁscal Q2 revenue was $5.8 billion, up 23% sequentially and up 58% year-over-
year. Fiscal Q2 DRAM revenue was approximately $4.2 billion, representing 71% of
total revenue. DRAM revenue increased 21% sequentially , with bit shipments
increasing by a low single-digit percentage and prices increasing by high teens.
Fiscal Q2 NAND revenue was approximately $1.6 billion, representing 27% of
Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 27% sequentially , with bit
shipments decreasing by a low single-digit percentage and prices increasing by over
30%.
Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking Business Unit
revenue was $2.2 billion, up 26% sequentially . Data center revenue grew robustly ,
and cloud more than doubled sequentially . Revenue for the Mobile Business Unit
was $1.6 billion, up 24% sequentially , as an expected decline in volume was more
than of fset by improved pricing.
Embedded Business Unit revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7% sequentially on solid
demand for leading-edge products in the industrial market. Revenue for the Storage
Business Unit was $905 million, up 39% sequentially with strong double-digit growth
across all end markets. Datacenter SSD revenue more than doubled from a year
ago, driven by share gains for Micron's products.
The consolidated gross margin for ﬁscal Q2 was 20%, up 19 percentage points
sequentially driven by higher pricing. Fiscal Q2 gross margins beneﬁted from $382
million associated with selling the remainder of previously written-down inventories.
In the second ﬁscal quarter , underutilization charges were modest and related to our
legacy manufacturing capacity . We expect to sustain these lower levels of
underutilization charges moving forward.
Operating expenses in ﬁscal Q2 were $959 million, down $33 million quarter-over-
quarter and in line with our guidance range. OpEx was modestly above the midpoint
of our guidance range, as variable compensation expense was higher on an
improved ﬁscal 2024 outlook. W e generated operating income of $204 million in
ﬁscal Q2, resulting in an operating margin of 4% and turning positive a quarter earlier
than originally forecasted.
We recognized a net beneﬁt for income taxes in ﬁscal Q2 of $294 million. W e had
previously guided that we would recognize tax expense of $45 million based on
expected quarterly results for ﬁscal Q2. With our improved ﬁscal 2024 outlook, we
can now estimate a more reliable annual ef fective tax rate and have reverted to a
global annual ef fective tax rate method. The second ﬁscal quarter tax beneﬁt arises
from applying this estimated annual ef fective tax rate to our year-to-date results.
Non-GAAP  diluted earnings per share in ﬁscal Q2 was $0.42, compared to a loss per
share of $0.95 in the prior quarter and a loss per share of $1.91 in the year-ago
quarter . Fiscal Q2 EPS beneﬁted from the aforementioned favorable income tax
effect of approximately $0.34 per share.
Turning to cash ﬂows and capital spending, our operating cash ﬂows were
approximately $1.2 billion in ﬁscal Q2, representing 21% of revenue. Capital
expenditures were $1.2 billion during the quarter , and free cash ﬂow was near
breakeven.
Our ﬁscal Q2 ending inventory was $8.4 billion or 160 days, roughly in line with the
prior quarter . Finished goods were down in the quarter . Our leading-edge supply both
for DRAM and NAND is very tight. W e expect to reduce inventory levels and
excluding strategic inventory stock, be within a few weeks of our 120 days target by
the end of ﬁscal 2024. W e project DIO improvements to continue into ﬁscal year
2025.
On the balance sheet, we held $9.7 billion of cash and investments at quarter end
and maintained $12.2 billion of liquidity when including our untapped credit facility .
During ﬁscal Q2, we reﬁnanced approximately $1 billion of existing debt, extending
our debt maturities and lowering our near-term borrowing costs. W e ended the
quarter with $13.7 billion in total debt, low net leverage, and a weighted average
maturity on our debt of 2031.
Now turning to our outlook for the ﬁscal third quarter . Fiscal Q3 bit shipments are
expected to be down modestly for DRAM and up somewhat for NAND, compared to
ﬁscal Q2 levels. While demand continues to improve, supply is constrained,
especially at the leading edge. W e expect DIO to improve sequentially in ﬁscal Q3.
Note that ﬁscal Q2 gross margins had the beneﬁt from previously written-down
inventories, which have cleared completely in ﬁscal Q2. Despite this beneﬁt in ﬁscal
Q2, we expect solid sequential improvement in ﬁscal Q3 gross margins due to robust
price increases across both DRAM and NAND.
We forecast operating expenses to increase by approximately $30 million in the
ﬁscal third quarter , driven by R&D expenses. For the ﬁscal year , we now project
OpEx to be approximately $4 billion. Having delivered operating proﬁt in ﬁscal Q2
ahead of prior expectations, we forecast continued improvement in operating income
through the remainder of the year .
Based on an improved taxable income outlook, our tax forecast for ﬁscal year 2024
has increased from a prior projection of over $300 million to approximately $400
million. In ﬁscal 2025, we expect our annual ef fective tax rate to be in the mid-teens
percentage range. W e plan ﬁscal Q3 capital expenditures to be higher than in the
second quarter . Our full-year ﬁscal 2024 CapEx plan is unchanged at a range
between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. W e now expect to generate positive free cash
ﬂow in ﬁscal Q3 and Q4.
With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP  guidance for ﬁscal Q3 is as follows. W e
expect revenue to be $6.6 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in
the range of 26.5%, plus or minus 150 basis points; and operating expenses to be
approximately $990 million, plus or minus $15 million. W e expect tax expenses of
approximately $240 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion
shares, we expect earnings per share of $0.45, plus or minus $0.07.
In closing, with a signiﬁcantly improved supply demand balance in the industry
coupled with excellent execution, Micron is driving a strong inﬂection in pricing and a
richer mix of high-value solutions. W e remain disciplined with our investments and
supply growth and focused on driving efﬁciency across the company . We expect
positive free cash ﬂow for the second half of ﬁscal 2024 and project record revenue
in ﬁscal 2025.
I will now turn it back over to Sanjay .
Sanjay Mehrotra
Thank you, Mark. [T echnical Difﬁculty]
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, your program will resume momentarily . Once again, please
standby , your program will resume momentarily . Thank you for your patience and
please continue to hold.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Hi, can you hear us?
Operator
Yes. Yes. W elcome back. Ladies and gentlemen, we will resume.
Sanjay Mehrotra
Yes, so we apologize for the technical difﬁculty here. But, operator if you can go
ahead and start the Q&A  section, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Certainly . One moment for our ﬁrst question. And our ﬁrst question comes from the
line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.
Toshiya Hari
Hi, can you guys hear me okay?
Operator
Yes.
Mark Murphy
Yes, we can.
Toshiya Hari
Okay , great. Thank you for taking the question. Sanjay on HBM, you mentioned that
you continue to expect your market position in '25 or at some point in '25 to be
similar , to be in line with your overall position in DRAM. Given your revenue outlook
for '24, that seems to imply , I don't know quadrupling or quintupling of your business
in HBM year-to-year . I guess part one, am I thinking about the trajectory accurately?
And then part two, how should we -- what does that mean for your CapEx over the
next 12, 18 months, and more importantly , your wafer capacity? You mentioned ﬁscal
year '24, you're down low-double-digits. Is your wafer capacity likely to be down
again in ﬁscal '25? Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So HBM3E, ﬁrst of all, it's a great product. As I mentioned well received by our
customers, high-performance, and 30% lower-power than any other product that's
out there. So of course it has strong demand and as we have highlighted, we are
sold out for our calendar year '24 supply and calendar year '25 supply is also mostly
vast majority is already allocated.
We are -- we have just begun production shipments, and these will continue to
increase through the course of calendar year '24, as well as continue to increase
through calendar year '25. W e are continuing to work on increasing our capacity and
making good progress with respect to capacity as well as overall yield and quality . So
certainly , in calendar year '25 versus calendar year '24, given that we are just starting
our production here now , will certainly be a signiﬁcant growth over our calendar year
'24 numbers.
And you can look at it the same way for ﬁscal '24 versus '25, so it will be deﬁnitely a
signiﬁcant increase with us, achieving our shares in HBM, in line with our industry
share, sometime in calendar '25. I'm not in a position to spell it out exactly for you in
terms of what is the volume increase, but certainly HBM with our strong product
position, it will be a strong driver of revenue growth, ﬁscal year '24 -- ﬁscal year '25 or
ﬁscal year '24.
Regarding the wafer capacity by end of this ﬁscal year , we have said low double-digit
structural reduction in capacity . And of course, we will be managing this capacity in
ﬁscal year '24, keeping in mind our focus on supply-demand discipline, I was staying
extremely disciplined with respect to supply growth, staying extremely disciplined
with respect to our HBM share as well. And advantaging our technology transitions,
as we go through the year .
And our CapEx in '25 -- well, in ﬁscal '25 will be higher than ﬁscal '24. WFE will be
higher as well. And of course, construction CapEx related to the Greenﬁeld that is
required for the second half of the decade will contribute to some of the CapEx
increase in ﬁscal '25. But some of those details we'll provide you as we get closer to
ﬁscal year '25.
So, most important thing is that we will manage our wafer capacity technology
transitions to really maintain our bit share, that is part of our strategy to have stable
bit share even with increasing penetration of HBM. And again, just keep in mind that
our overall framework of our CapEx being 35% of our revenue across the cycles still
applies.
Toshiya Hari
Thank you for all the details.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Aaron Rakers from W ells Fargo. Your question, please.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. Thank you very much for taking the question. I guess two real quick ones. One I
just wanted to understand or maybe appreciate the context of the accretive nature of
HBM3. I know in the prepared remarks, I think are -- in the slide deck it notes that
you'll be accretive gross margin from HBM in the current quarter . And then I know
you talked a little bit about PCs and smartphones. I'm curious of -- what you're
seeing in terms of traditional server demand and whether or not your forecast
assumes any improvement of shipments in that end-market. Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So with respect to the accretive nature of HBM, look, HBM carries a higher cost, but
it also carries a signiﬁcantly higher pricing because it brings such great value in the
applications in terms of its performance and power . And we are executing well. Our
yield ramp is going well as well according to plan. And therefore, we are pleased that
in this quarter when we have begun our production shipments, we will be having it
accretive to our gross margins in the quarter . And of course, this momentum will
continue to build in the quarters ahead.
And regarding the second part of your question on traditional server demand, so yes,
we do see that in calendar '25, traditional server demand will grow modestly . And of
course, it's coming after a signiﬁcant decline in server unit sales in calendar '23. W e
are very pleased to see the increasing momentum of content growth in the traditional
server demand. But also AI server units are going up and AI -- we have said overall
server units going up in mid- to high-single-digits range with AI server driving a
higher growth percentage year-over-year and traditional servers being modest.
And I may have said '25 here, I just want to clarify that I'm talking about 2024 here.
So when I'm talking about modest server unit growth, it's referring to 2024 versus
2023.
Aaron Rakers
Thank you.
Sanjay Mehrotra
And we are actually seeing strong demand for both our DRAM products and NAND
products in server and actually we are shifting some of our portfolio toward these
higher mix solutions. HBM being one of them. High-density DIMMs being another
one that's in strong demand for server applications and then data center SSDs. All of
this is -- we are seeing a healthy demand drivers.
And just remember we had said that for memory and storage, customer inventories
in data center market would be largely normalized in ﬁrst half of '24. And we are
seeing the market play out just as we had predicted several quarters ago.
Aaron Rakers
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your question, please.
C.J. Muse
Yes, good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. I guess, Sanjay , would love to
hear your thoughts around wafer movement from Big 3 to HBM and what impact
that's having on the supply-demand outlook for DDR5 and sort of any context around
customer engagement and longer-term contracts?
And then more on the gross margin side, you've talked about the inventory
previously written down, now behind us. Can you walk through the moving parts that
should dictate what we'll see in gross margins throughout the remainder of calendar
'24? Thanks so much.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So on your questions regarding wafers shift to HBM, as we have highlighted that
HBM -- HBM3E needs three times more wafers than nearly three times more wafers
than DDR5 in the same technology node of the same capacity to produce the same
bits. So this is of course highly silicon intensive technology and this factor of three
has the trade ratio between HBM and D5 is really common across the industry .
So what -- and HBM demand is increasing rapidly , you see all the recent
announcements that are only showing you that even greater attach rate of HBM to
the latest GPU solutions that were just announced earlier this week. 192 gigabyte in
the Blackwell platforms versus the 144 gigabyte. And of course, this is a
phenomenon that's occurring across the Board. Even today , I think, Broadcom talked
about how HBM content is going to further increase. So HBM is in a high-demand
growth phase and this demand growth will continue in terms of bits, in terms of
revenue over the course of the foreseeable future.
And this is putting tremendous pressure on the non-HBM supply . The trade ratio of
three to one, increasing demand in HBM, increasing -- increased proﬁtability of HBM
is putting non-HBM part of the memory in tight supply . This is why we say that
leading-edge nodes are in very tight supply . And as a result, we would fully expect
that D5, as well as other DDR products will improve in their proﬁtability picture as
well, given their very much tight supply there. And of course, HBM being in a strong
position. When you look at the L TAs, we have talked to you about our supply already
being locked up for '24 and '25, and this then increases our conﬁdence in our D5 as
well as LP5 -- LP A positions with the customers.
Mark Murphy
And good afternoon, C.J., it's Mark. On the gross margin side, as you mentioned it's
been a tough year , plus year and a half on a lot of timing dif ferences, difﬁcult to
gauge the cost downs and gross margin progression underutilization ef fects, lower
node transitions, structural capacity-reduction and so forth that we're contributing to
the weaker cost downs.
And as you mentioned, the lower the written-down inventories, ﬁnally cleared in the
second quarter . It was a bit of a headwind to actually in the sense that, it was less of
a beneﬁt than the ﬁrst quarter . So, but still, nonetheless it was a favorable beneﬁt
that we will market in the third quarter . And then the period costs also reduced from
ﬁrst to second quarter . So, we're now under $50 million on period costs related to
underutilization.
As I mentioned in my comments that's legacy-related capacity now only and that
would continue going forward. So now we see more normal conditions on cost
downs and related margin ef fects. W e see node transitions occurring. Those are
positive. The underutilization ef fects are fading away , as we mentioned. W e're getting
volume leverage and the associated absorption and then just the business being
able to focus on efﬁciency . So as we mentioned before, we're now in the front end
would expect mid to high-single-digit cost downs as normal.
I think that as you look forward, and Sanjay alluded to this, you will begin to see the
costs related to HBM weigh on our cost down performance. Now it's a good trade, of
course, because the mix is favorable, the price is higher on those products. So it's an
accretive margin trade, but that will impact the cost downs.
C.J. Muse
Very helpful. Thank you.

Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your question please.
Timothy Arcuri
Thanks a lot. Sanjay , I had a question just around the tenor of the discussions that
you're having with your customers. I mean the industry is bigger this year in terms of
bits. It sounds like mostly due to a higher baseline coming of f last year . But it sounds
like supply hasn't really increased to match that higher bits this year . So the balance
has gotten even tighter over the past three months.
So how has that changed the dynamics of your discussions with your customers? I
know you had a $600 million prepay last quarter . Did you get any prepays this
quarter? Are you talking about new sort of contract structures with customers where
they maybe fund some of your CapEx? Can you kind of talk about all that? Thanks.
Sanjay Mehrotra
So just keep in mind that in ﬁscal year '24 or calendar '24 versus '23, the shipments
will increase substantially . And as you noted, I mean, the year-over-year increase in
shipments will be substantial. And as you noted, the supply is very tight. Supply is
tight due to the factors that we have discussed before. Due to the downturn that the
industry experienced last year , CapEx cuts were made, utilization cuts were made,
structural shift from traditional older nodes to newer nodes of equipment was made
in order to support the leading-edge nodes. And that resulted in a structural reduction
in wafer capacity in the industry as well.
And then there is the HBM factor , the trade ratio 3:1 that I have discussed today . All
of this has contributed to a very tight supply situation. And as I noted earlier in my
remarks, non-HBM supply is tight. So some of our discussions with customers,
particularly with respect to HBM, when we talk about that HBM is sold out, those type
of contracts have both pricing as well as volumes as well as other stricter terms
baked in as part of our L TAs. And 2024 volume as well as pricing is all locked up.
2025, as I mentioned, the volumes are largely allocated. A vast majority of our
production supply is allocated, and some of the pricing is already ﬁrmed up. Keep in
mind, this has never happened before, right, that we are talking about 2025, and we
are sitting in CQ1, and we already have so much discussion around supply and
pricing for 2025 getting locked up here as we speak. And of course, this is then, as I
said earlier , impacting our -- in a positive way , our discussions with non-HBM part of
the market with other customers.
And so, I mean, this overall tight supply environment bodes well for our ability to
manage the pricing increases as well as keep an eye on demand-supply balance
and remain extremely disciplined in driving the growth of our business in revenue
and proﬁts while continuing to execute our strategy of maintaining stable bit share.
So leading edge is very tight, and we are continuing to work on maximizing our
output, which means leading edge is running at full utilization at this point.
Timothy Arcuri
Great, thanks. But I guess that means that there were no prepays this quarter ,
correct?
Sanjay Mehrotra
Well, we have not commented on that. W e have not provided any color on that.
Timothy Arcuri
Okay , okay . Thank you, Sanjay .
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley . Your question please.
Joseph Moore
Great, thank you. The 128 gig that you talked about getting qualiﬁed, it seems like
that's a pretty important market in AI. And you guys are approaching it monolithically
where I know your competitor has used this packed approach. Can you talk about
the reception to that, and you spoke of several hundred million. How big do you think
that opportunity could be?
Sanjay Mehrotra
As I said, I mean, in my prepared remarks, that this product has very strong
customer pull. This really of fers signiﬁcantly improved latency , as well as energy
efﬁciency . And this is simply due to the architecture that we chose to pursue fully
focusing on what is ultimately important to our customers. This mono die architecture
just gives you -- versus a stacked architecture gives you the beneﬁt of more
simpliﬁed interconnect, which results in power efﬁciency as well as greater
performance advantage.
So yes, I mean, we are seeing strong reception to this product. And this will -- we
have said that this will have a meaningful revenue this ﬁscal quarter for us and
several hundred million dollars of revenue in our ﬁscal 2024. So clearly on a strong
growth rate. And our goal, again, would be to continue to manage the mix of our
business across our portfolio in a prudent fashion so that we continue to shift the mix
of our products towards more proﬁtable parts of the business, particularly like data
centers, solutions, including these high-capacity DIMMs that we just discussed as --
HBM, data center , SSD.
So all of this really just shows you that how we are continuing to deliver successfully
on strengthening our product portfolio and targeted -- targeting it towards increasing
the mix of our business towards more proﬁtable parts of the market.
Joseph Moore
Great, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from
the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your question, please.
Brian Chin
Hi, great. Thanks for taking our questions and congratulations on the results. I guess
it is sort of an extrapolation question. But if HBM worth 20% of Micron DRAM
revenue, and you have said that, again, at some point next year , you think on a bit
basis, it could be equivalent to your market share, that HBM were 20% of Micron
DRAM revenue as opposed to a much lower percentage today . Could you maybe
help quantify how accretive to gross margins as that richer mix would represent?
Mark Murphy
Yes. Brian, it's Mark. W e won't break it out speciﬁcally , but maybe just to give you a
sense of the trajectory of gross margins. The increase from ﬁrst quarter of 1% to 20%
in the second quarter was dominantly price. And obviously , a lot of other things going
on, but the dominant feature of that increase was price.
Likewise, in the 20% second quarter actuals to the 26.5% guide, price remains the
largest contributor . And of fsetting part of that is, of course, what CJ mentioned on the
beneﬁt of those lower cost inventories fade away . So -- but price is still the largest
factor . But what begins to come in are both a resumption of cost downs. And then
we're starting to see some favorable mix ef fects for the products that Sanjay talked
about, including HBM.
And then as we move into the fourth quarter , where we would expect a margin
increase comparable to the levels that we saw second to third quarter . That becomes
more balanced between price ef fects and product mix ef fects and cost downs. And
most notably , HBM begins to become more material. And that would then proceed
into '25.
As we look in '25, we see continued pricing strength in '25. W e see favorable product
mixes -- product mix in '25. And then our cost downs, excluding the HBM ef fects, we
expect to have good cost down, all contributing to margin expansion.
Brian Chin
Okay . Thank you, very helpful.
Operator
Thank you. One moment for our next question. And for our last question for today
comes from the line of Chris Danely from Citi. Your question, please.
Chris Danely
Hey, thanks, guys. I guess just another multipart question on margins like everybody
else. So you mentioned that there's still some underutilization charges related to
legacy manufacturing capacity . When do those go away?
And then as a follow-up to all these HBM margin questions. Can you just talk about
the gross margin arc of your HBM products as more competition and capacity comes
on to the market? Like when would the gross margins peak and then start to decline
as Samsung starts to increase capacity , your capacity goes up, all that stuf f? Thanks.
Mark Murphy
I'll deal with the ﬁrst question. On the underutilization charges, Chris, they went from,
I think it was $165 million in the ﬁrst quarter down to under $50 million in the second
quarter . We believe they'll stay at low levels well below 50 for the foreseeable future.
So we'll no longer comment on those. And again, as I mentioned in my comments,
they're related to the legacy capacity .
Sanjay Mehrotra
And regarding your question on gross margin projections for HBM, so we are not
going to do that here. W e are totally focused on increasing our production capability
and bringing in 2025 a bit share for DRAM -- for HBM to be in line with our DRAM
share.
And of course, this will bring about greater proﬁtability opportunities, but we are really
not projecting pricing of HBM here in the future. But clearly , HBM brings tremendous
value in the applications. You are seeing these new platforms that are hungry for
more HBM, and HBM has been in shortage, and we have talked about our '24 and
'25 supply being spoken for .
So all of that, I think, bodes well for high revenue growth and highly proﬁtable HBM
business for us. And of course, we will stay extremely focused on maintaining
discipline, maintaining our CapEx discipline and maintaining our share target
discipline for HBM and really staying very disciplined on overall supply growth being
in line with our DRAM share for the whole DRAM part of our business. So I think
these will be key as we continue to look ahead at our execution and driving our
opportunities forward.
Chris Danely
Got it. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's
program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now
