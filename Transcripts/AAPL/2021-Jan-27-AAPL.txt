Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

Today's call is being recorded.









At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over

to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go

Tejas Gala

Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking

Tim Cook

Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. It's

with great gratitude for the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member

worldwide that I share the results of a very strong quarter for Apple. We achieved an

all-time revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across

every product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our

geographic segments.
It is not far from many of our minds that this result caps off the most challenging year

any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to say that the challenges it

posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison to the challenge it posed to Apple

as a community of individuals, to employees, to their families and to the communities

we live in and love to call home.


While these results show the central role that our products played in helping our

users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead of all of

us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and prosperity in our

neighborhoods and local economies and, to build back with a sense of justice is

profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and Apple's efforts throughout

today's call, but I want to 
fi
rst offer the context of a detailed look at our results this

quarter, including why we outperformed our expectations.
Let's get started with hardware. We hit a new high watermark for our installed base

of active devices, with growth accelerating as we passed 1.65 billion devices

worldwide during the December quarter. iPhone grew by 17% year-over-year, driven

by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family, and our active installed base of iPhones

is now over 1 billion. The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models'

unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing

potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact

at retail locations.
iPad and Mac grew by 41% and 21%, respectively, re
fl
ecting the continuing role

these devices have played in our users' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During

this quarter, availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the 
fi
rst generation

of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip. The demand for all of these products

has been very strong.
We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest iPads, enriching content and

professional support to educators, students and parents. Educational districts and

governments worldwide are continuing major deployments, including the largest iPad

deployments ever to schools in Germany and Japan.
Wearables, Home and Accessories grew by 30% year-over-year, driven by signi
fi
cant

holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods lineup, including the

new AirPods Max as well as the new HomePod mini. This broad strength across the

category led to new revenue records for each of its three subgroups, and we're very

excited about the road ahead for these products.
Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to

deliver real-time on-screen 
fi
tness data alongside world-class workouts by the

world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are

loving the 
fl
exibility, challenge and fun of these classes as well as how the pairing

with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your 
fi
tness goals.


This deep integration of hardware, software and services, have always de
fi
ned our

approach here, and it has delivered an all-time quarterly Services record of $15.8

billion. This was the 
fi
rst quarter of the Apple One bundle, which brings together

many of our great services into an easy subscription and with new content being

added to these services every day, we feel very optimistic about where we are

headed.
The App Store ecosystem has been so important as individuals, families and

businesses worldwide evolve and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to

make sure that this unrivaled engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This

quarter, we also took a signi
fi
cant new step to help smaller developers continue to

experiment, innovate and scale the latest great app ideas.
The App Store Small Business Program reduces the commission on the sale of

digital goods and services to 15% for small businesses earning less than $1 million a

year. The program launched on January 1st and we are already hearing from

developers about how this change represents a transformation in their potential to

create and grow on the App Store.
Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards to

protect users' right to privacy, not just for our own products but to be the ripple in the

pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently, we're in the process of

deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem that give users more

knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that apps gather and share their

personal data.
The winter holiday season is always a busy times for us and our products, but this

year was unique. We had a record number of device activations during the last week

of the quarter. And as COVID-19 kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of

FaceTime calls ever this Christmas. As always, we could not have made so many

holidays special without our talented and dedicated retail teams who helped us

achieve a new all-time revenue record for retail, driven by very strong performance in

our online store.
Particularly, after the events of the last few weeks, we are focused on how we can

help a moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions

about the challenges we face as we began a new chapter in the American story.

Hope for healing, for unity and for progress begins with and depends on addressing

the things that continue to wound us.
In our communities, we see how every burden from COVID-19, to the resulting

economic challenges, to the closure of in-person learning for students, falls heaviest

on those who have always faced structural barriers to opportunity and equality. This

month, Apple announced major new commitments through a $100 million Racial

Equity & Justice Initiative.


The Propel Center, launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of

historically black colleges and universities across the country, will help support the

next-generation of leaders in 
fi
elds ranging from machine learning to app

development to entrepreneurship and design.
And our new Apple Developer Academy in Downtown Detroit will be the 
fi
rst of its

kind in the United States. Detroit has a vibrant culture of black entrepreneurship,

including over 50,000 black-owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential

of the app economy here, knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a

creative, resilient and dedicated community.
Finally, we're committing $35 million across two investments in Harlem Capital and

the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate and grow minority-owned

businesses in areas of great potential and need. In December, we concluded an

unmatched year of giving.
Since the inception of the Apple Giving Program in 2011, Apple employees have

donated nearly $600 million and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over

34,000 organizations of every stride. Through our partnership with Product Red,

we've adapted our 14-year $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally

to ensure that care of COVID. That includes delivering millions of units of personal

protective equipment to health care providers in Zambia.
And here in the United States, even with COVID's effects, we are ahead of schedule

on our multiyear commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the American

economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be done.

Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic but we must

also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side.
When a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now,

we see the deep scars that this period has left in our communities. Trust has been

compromised, opportunities have been lost, entire portions of our lives that we took

for granted, schools for children, meetings with our colleagues, small businesses that

have endured for generations have simply disappeared.
It will take a society-wide effort across the public and private sectors as individuals

and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what's ahead of us is not simply the

end of a disease, but the beginning of something durable and hopeful for those who

gave, suffered and endured during this time.
At Apple, we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to

working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter of

uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay safe,

connected and well.
With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.


Luca Maestri

Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our 
fi
scal 2021 with

exceptional business and 
fi
nancial performance during the December quarter, as we

set all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share

and operating cash 
fl
ow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continued to

innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty.
Our revenue reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20

billion or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product

categories, with all-time records for iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and

services as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved double-

digit growth and new all-time records in each of our 
fi
ve geographic segments and in

the vast majority of countries that we track.
Products revenue was an all-time record of $95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago. As

a consequence of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our

customers, our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the

December quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product

categories.
Our Services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year-over-year. We

established new all-time records in most service categories and December quarter

records in each geographic segment. I'll cover our Services business in more detail

later. Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially, thanks to

leverage from higher sales and a strong mix.
Products gross margin was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by

leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points

sequentially, mainly due to a different mix.
Net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash 
fl
ow were all-time

records. Net income was $28.8 billion, up $6.5 billion or 29% over last year. Diluted

earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year and operating cash 
fl
ow was

$38.8 billion, an improvement of $8.2 billion.
Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was

a record $65.6 billion, growing 17% year-over-year as demand for the iPhone 12

family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which

have impacted store operations in a signi
fi
cant manner.
Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now

surpassed 1 billion devices, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base

and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers

from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12

family.


Turning to Services. As I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion

and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising, AppleCare

and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple

News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle are also

contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and

features.
The key drivers for our Services growth all continue to move in the right direction:
fi
rst, our installed base growth has accelerated and each major product category;

second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content

stores reached a new all-time high during the December quarter, with paid accounts

increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments; third, paid

subscriptions continue to grow nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid

subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020.
During the December quarter, we added more than 35 million sequentially, and we

now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions across the services on our

platform, up 140 million from just a year ago. Finally, we continue to improve the

breadth and quality of our current Services offerings and are adding new services

that we think our customers will love. For example, Apple Music recently released its

biggest product update ever with features like Listen Now, all new Search, personal

radio stations and auto play. 90% of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used

these new features.
In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage, with nearly 90% of stores

in the United States now accepting Apple Pay so that customers can easily have a

touchless payments experience. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 30% year-

over-year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records in every geographic

segment. As a result of this strong performance, our Wearables business is now the

size of a Fortune 120 company.
Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the

customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.

We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of

hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer

experience in this category.
Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set a December quarter record for revenue at

$8.7 billion up 21% over last year. We grew strong-double-digits in each geographic

segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Paci
fi
c as well

as December quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and in Japan. This

performance was driven by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro

and Mac mini, all powered by our brand-new M1 chip.


iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $8.4 billion, up 41%. We

grew strong -- very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an

all-time record in Japan. During the quarter, the new -- the all-new iPad Air became

available and customer response has been terri
fi
c. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly

relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning

environments. And we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from

451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 94% for iPad.
With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers

purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active

installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time

highs.
In the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology

investment in response to COVID. One example is our businesses are handling their

hundreds of millions of of
fi
ce desk phones while more employees are working

remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, one of the largest banks in the world,

announced that it will be replacing 75% of its 
fi
xed phones with iPhones. By doing

so, it expects to realize signi
fi
cant cost savings while providing a secure mobile

platform to employees.
We're also pleased with the rapid adoption of the Mac Employee Choice Program

among the world's leading businesses, who are seeing improved productivity,

increased employee satisfaction and talent retention. With the introduction of M1-

powered Macs, we're excited to extend these experiences to an even broader range

of customers and employees, especially in times of increased remote working.
Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $196 billion

in cash plus marketable securities and retired $1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us

with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $84 billion at the end of the

quarter. We returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter,

including $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $24 billion through open

market repurchases of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to

reaching a net cash neutral position over time.
As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we

are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas

referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the

world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a speci
fi
c revenue range. However,

we are providing some directional insights, assuming that COVID-related impacts of

our business do not worsen from our current assumptions for the quarter.


For total company revenue, we believe growth will accelerate on a year-over-year

basis, and in aggregate, follow typical seasonality on a sequential basis. At the

product category level, keep in mind two items: 
fi
rst, during the March quarter last

year, we saw elevated activity in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around

the world, so our Services business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison;

second, we believe the year-over-year growth in the Wearables, Home and

Accessories category will decelerate compared to Q1.
As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expanded

channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods channel

inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter.
We expect gross margin to be similar to the December quarter. We expect OpEx to

be between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be up around $50

million and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has

declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on February

11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021.
With that, let's open the call to questions.

A - Tejas Gala

Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we

have the 
fi
rst question, please?

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

We'll go question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Katy Huberty

Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The gross margin

was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you

recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter, given your

typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and

tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? And then I have a

follow-up for Tim.

Luca Maestri


Yes, Katy. So yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated

at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously, we had very

strong leverage from higher sales. And the mix was strong, both the mix within

products and the mix of services, and that was only partially offset by cost. As you

know, we've launched many new products during the fall, and that always comes

with new cost structures. So in total, it was very good.
And from the FX standpoint, really, at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role

neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter, partially

because of the hedges that you talked about but also because some currencies are

still weaker against the dollar, they're still weaker than a year ago. Look speci
fi
cally

to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on.
Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a

tailwind for us as we get into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some

level of bene
fi
t around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.

Katy Huberty

That's great. And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just a limited

visibility that investors have into the road map and any new categories that you might

enter over time. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you

talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might

be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter

new markets?

Tim Cook

Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thanks for not asking me any speci
fi
cs. The

framework that we use is very much around we ask ourselves if this is a product that

we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves.

And that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in

unless it's an adjacency product, of which we're looking at it very much from a

customer experience point of view.
And so there's no set way that we're looking at it, no formula kind of thing. But we're

taking into account all of those things, and the kind of things that we love to work on

are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software and services to come

together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so

hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it.
