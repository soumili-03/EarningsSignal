Jim   Friedland,   Director   Investor   Relations:    Thank   you.   Good   afternoon,   everyone,   and   
welcome   to   Alphabet’s   third   quarter   2021   earnings   conference   call.   With   us   today   are   Sundar   
Pichai,   Philipp   Schindler   and   Ruth   Porat.   Now   I’ll   quickly   cover   the   Safe   Harbor.   Some   of   the   
statements   that   we   make   today   regarding   our   business,   operations,   and   financial   performance,   
including   the   effect   of   the   COVID-19   pandemic   on   those   areas,   may   be   considered   
forward-looking,   and   such   statements   involve   a   number   of   risks   and   uncertainties   that   could   
cause   actual   results   to   differ   materially.   For   more   information,   please   refer   to   the   risk   factors   
discussed   in   our   most   recent   Forms   10-K   and   10-Q   filed   with   the   SEC.   During   this   call,   we   will   
present   both   GAAP   and   non-GAAP   financial   measures.   A   reconciliation   of   non-GAAP   to   GAAP   
measures   is   included   in   today's   earnings   press   release,   which   is   distributed   and   available   to   the   
public   through   our   Investor   Relations   website   located   at   abc.xyz/investor.   And   now   I’ll   turn   the   
call   over   to   Sundar.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thank   you,   Jim,   and   good   afternoon,   everyone.   In   
2016,   I   laid   out   our   vision   to   become   an   AI-first   company.   Five   years   later,   this   quarter’s   results  
show   how   our   investments   in   AI   are   building   more   helpful   products   for   people,   and   for   our   
partners   and   local   communities.   Today,   I’ll   begin   with   new   product   highlights.   Then   I’ll   cover   our   
Cloud   business,   followed   by   YouTube.   
  
First,   product   highlights.   Search   remains   the   heart   of   what   we   do.   We’ve   made   remarkable   
advances   over   the   past   23   years   that   benefit   Search   and   related   products   like   Google   Assistant   
--   which   just   celebrated   five   years.   Earlier   this   year,   we   announced   that   we   reached   a   significant   
milestone   with   Multitask   Unified   Model,   or   MUM   for   short.   MUM   is   a   thousand   times   more   
powerful   than   BERT   and   can   understand   information   across   many   contexts,   like   text   and   
images.   At   our   SearchOn   event   in   September,   we   shared   how   we’re   using   MUM   to   improve   
Google   Lens   so   people   can   search   using   both   images   and   words.   We   also   shared   that   we’re   
bringing   a   more   visual   shopping   experience   to   Search,   powered   by   the   Google   Shopping   
Graph.   It   links   shoppers   with   over   24   billion   product   listings   from   merchants   across   the   web.     
  
Google   Maps   now   offers   eco-friendly   routing.   It   lets   drivers   in   the   U.S.   choose   a   more   
fuel-efficient   route,   saving   money   and   reducing   emissions.   Maps   now   has   a   wildfire   layer   so   that   
people   can   get   up-to-date   details   and   make   quick,   informed   decisions   during   emergencies.     
  
Finally   in   Search   and   our   Discover   feed,   we’re   continuing   to   support   the   news   ecosystem   and   
make   quality   journalism   more   accessible.   Philipp   will   give   a   bit   more   detail   about   our   News   
Showcase   partnerships.   
  
1   
Turning   next   to   Hardware,   I   hope   you   saw   our   Fall   Pixel   event   last   week.   I’m   very   excited   about   
the   range   of   Pixel   phones   available   this   holiday   season.   The   new   Pixel   6   and   6   Pro   bring   
together   the   best   of   Google   AI,   software,   and   hardware,   with   the   most   advanced   and   inclusive  
cameras   we’ve   ever   built.   They’re   beautiful,   fast   and   powered   by   Google   Tensor,   our   first-ever   
system   on   a   chip.   It   is   specifically   built   to   support   Google   AI   and   machine   learning   on-device.   
And   provides   a   long   term   foundation   for   our   Pixel   devices.   We   also   introduced   our   new   Nest   
Renew   program,   which   uses   Nest   thermostats   to   support   clean   energy   use   in   the   home.   
  
On   to   Android.   Android   12   is   getting   great   reviews.   It’s   the   biggest   design   change   in   Android's   
history,   with   new   widgets   to   personalize   your   phone.   We   also   introduced   accessibility   features   
that   use   gestures   to   control   your   phone   and   communicate.   Android   12   is   secure   by   default   and   
private   by   design.   New   dashboards   and   indicators   make   it   easier   to   view   and   adjust   privacy   
permissions,   and   disable   access   to   device   sensors   and   location   information.   We’ve   also   made   
progress   with   a   made-for-India   affordable   smartphone   co-developed   with   Reliance.   The   
JioPhone   Next   device   features   premium,   localized   capabilities,   and   is   on   track   to   launch   
in-market   by   Diwali.   
  
On   to   Cloud,   where   we   see   continued   momentum   with   Q3   revenue   growing   45%   
year-over-year,   with   GCP’s   revenue   growth   rate   above   Cloud   overall.   At   Cloud   Next   two   weeks   
ago,   we   unveiled   hundreds   of   new   capabilities,   services,   and   solutions.   We   also   announced   
twenty   new   and   expanded   partnerships   to   support   the   growth   and   scale   of   our   customers   
around   the   world.   More   than   any   other   top   cloud   provider,   Google   Cloud   has   unique   capabilities   
to   meet   the   needs   of   enterprises,   digital   natives   and   SMBs   around   the   world.   I’ll   highlight   three:   
    
First,   our   leadership   in   real-time   data,   analytics   and   AI   is   winning   customers   like   Carrefour   
Belgium,   Deutsche   Post   DHL,   and   Wendy’s,   who   are   unlocking   data   to   deliver   unique   business   
outcomes.   BigQuery,   our   leading   data   warehouse   solution,   is   reducing   costs   and   driving   
productivity   at   Cardinal   Health   and   ATB   Financial.   Our   differentiated   AI   and   ML-based   industry   
solutions   are   helping   leading   global   companies.   GE   Appliances,   a   Haier   company,   is   integrating   
Vision   AI   into   their   next-generation   smart   home   appliances.   And   IKEA   Retail   is   using   
Recommendations   AI   to   drive   a   30%   increase   in   customer   click-through   rate.   
  
Second,   customers   see   value   in   our   open,   scalable   infrastructure   that   enables   them   to   run   
workloads   anywhere   –   on   our   Cloud,   at   the   edge,   or   in   their   data   centers.   Rodan   and   Fields   
scaled   its   SAP   environment,   Siemens   Energy   is   migrating   its   global   network   of   data   centers   and   
company-wide   SAP   systems,   and   Indonesia’s   largest   technology   digital   native   GoTo   Group   is   
supporting   over   100   million   monthly   active   users   with   Google   Cloud.   General   Mills,   Bell   Canada   
and   Wells   Fargo   are   harnessing   our   leadership   in   multi-cloud   and   our   open   development   
environment;   and   to   meet   the   unique   digital   sovereignty   needs   of   customers   around   the   world,   
we   announced   industry-first   partnerships   with   T-Systems   in   Germany   and   Thales   in   France.   
  
Third,   as   consumers,   businesses   and   schools   continue   their   shift   towards   hybrid   work,   the   
threats   of   cybersecurity   continue   to   increase.   Customers   are   turning   to   Google   Workspace   and   
our   cybersecurity   platform   to   provide   the   ease   of   use,   collaboration   and   security   they   need.   
These   include   organizations   like   Discovery,   Common   Spirit   Health,   and   the   state   of   Maryland   
who   want   to   foster   creativity   while   securely   protecting   their   users.    
  
We   are   also   seeing   strong   growth   in   our   broad   portfolio   of   cybersecurity   products.   This   includes   
Chronicle,   one   of   our   zero   trust   offerings,   which   JetBlue   uses   to   detect   cybersecurity   threats,   
helping   to   protect   its   customers   and   enterprise.   
  
2   
We   are   bringing   our   team’s   deep   expertise   to   customers   through   the   Google   Cybersecurity   
Action   Team   and   a   new   Work   Safer   program,   which   provides   best-in-class   security   for   emails,   
meetings,   messaging   and   more.   
  
Earlier,   I   mentioned   a   few   of   the   sustainability   related   product   features   we   announced.   Our   
Cloud   customers   already   benefit   from   operating   on   the   world’s   cleanest   cloud,   and   last   year   we   
set   an   ambitious   goal   to   run   our   data   centers   and   campuses   on   24/7   carbon-free   energy   by   
2030.   Two   thirds   of   the   electricity   consumed   by   Google   data   centers   in   2020   was   matched   with   
local,   carbon-free   sources   on   an   hourly   basis.   And   our   new   Carbon   Footprint   tool   gives   
customers   carbon   emissions   insights   associated   with   their   Google   Cloud   Platform   usage.     
  
Now,   over   to   YouTube   for   a   few   highlights.   We   recently   surpassed   fifty   million   Music   and   
Premium   subscribers,   including   those   in   trial.   And   YouTube   Shorts   continues   to   see   high   
adoption   rates.   In   the   past   year,   the   average   number   of   daily   first   time   creators   more   than   
doubled.   Next   week,   as   global   leaders   gather   in   Glasgow   to   address   climate   change,   YouTube  
is   partnering   with   COP26   to   livestream   conference   activities,   making   the   event   more   accessible   
for   everyone.   As   we   grow,   we’re   maintaining   our   open   global   platform   responsibly   by   removing   
harmful   content   and   reducing   borderline   content.   Both   our   AI   investments   and   the   promotion   of   
trusted   sources   have   helped   us   significantly   lower   the   violative   view   rate,   which   is   the   
percentage   of   views   on   YouTube   from   content   that   violates   our   policies.     
  
On   to   our   Other   Bets.   Waymo   began   welcoming   riders   to   its   Trusted   Tester   program   in   San   
Francisco,   in   addition   to   its   fully   autonomous   ride-hailing   service   currently   in   Phoenix.   Next   year,   
Waymo   will   open   a   dedicated   trucking   hub   in   the   Dallas-Fort   Worth   area,   helping   support   
commercial   freight   routes   across   the   Southwest.   And   we   announced   last   week   the   first   
commercial   expansion   of   Wing’s   on-demand   air   delivery   service   to   Walgreens   customers   in   
select   locations.     
  
To   close…the   world   is   slowly   starting   to   travel   and   meet   up   in   person,   and   this   quarter   I   joined   
events   virtually   to   celebrate   some   big   milestones   in   regions   around   the   world.   Earlier   this   month,   
we   announced   a   $1   billion   investment   in   Africa   over   five   years   to   support   the   continent’s   digital   
transformation.   And   September   marked   20   years   since   we   opened   our   first   office   outside   of   the   
U.S.,   in   Tokyo.   We   now   have   thousands   of   employees   in   28   offices   across   the   Asia   Pacific   
region,   and   we’re   investing   in   cloud   regions   and   digital   skills   programs   to   help   expand   economic   
opportunity   there.   As   you   can   see,   our   business   in   APAC   is   growing   really   well.   In   Africa,   
Asia-Pacific   and   beyond,   it’s   been   a   successful   quarter.   And   we   have   lots   more   innovation   and  
product   development   on   the   way.     
  
Thanks   to   our   employees   around   the   world   for   their   contributions.   As   we   continue   our   move   to   
hybrid   work,   I   hope   to   see   more   of   you   in   person   soon.   Thank   you,   and   over   to   Philipp.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Thanks,   Sundar   –   and   hi   everyone.   It’s   great   to   be   
with   you   all   today.   We’re   pleased   with   the   growth   in   Google   Services   revenues   in   the   third   
quarter.   Year-on-year   performance   was   driven   by   broad-based   strength   in   advertiser   spend.   
Consumer   online   activity   also   remained   elevated.   
  
In   the   third   quarter,   Retail   was   again   by   far   the   largest   contributor   to   year-on-year   growth   of   our   
Ads   business.   Media   &   Entertainment,   Finance,   and   Travel   were   also   strong   contributors.    Let’s   
take   a   deeper   look   at   some   of   the   trends   that   drove   this   quarter’s   performance.   
  
3   
First,   from   a   big   picture,   global   recovery   perspective   –   we   continue   to   see   a   lot   of   unevenness.   
Some   economies   have   restarted   and   reaccelerated   –   albeit   at   different   speeds.   Other   countries,   
depending   on   local   regulations   and   vaccines,   have   been   slower   to   rebound.   
  
It’s   clear   that   uncertainty   is   the   new   normal.   The   world   is   in   flux.   So   when   it   comes   to   
anticipating   change,   predicting   demand,   and   investing   in   innovation,   businesses   need   as   much   
support   now   as   they   did   a   year   and   a   half   ago.   And   we   continue   to   help.   
  
Like   in   travel   –   where   hotel   free   booking   links   are   increasing   traffic   for   many   partners   -   from   
OTAs   to   boutique   hotels.   Consumers   like   more   choice.   Travel   partners   like   free   exposure.   And   
advertisers   like   to   augment   paid   campaigns   with   free   listings.   So   last   month   we   launched   free   
booking   links   for   “things   to   do”   and   a   new   ad   format   that   makes   it   easier   to   promote   local   
experiences.   Now,   when   you   search   ziplining,   aquariums,   or   the   Tokyo   Tower,   you   can   buy   
tickets   directly   on   Google.   And   then   there   are   companies   like   Alaska   Airlines   that   are   
harnessing   first-party   data   and   automation   across   Search   to   navigate   market   fluidity   and   better   
understand   the   lifetime   value   of   their   customers.   They’ve   increased   return   on   ad   spend   by   30%+   
vs.   the   same   period   pre-Covid.   
  
Beyond   travel,   businesses   of   all   kinds   are   increasingly   adopting   tools   like   AI-driven   automation   
and   insights   to   connect   with   customers   –   no   matter   what   stage   of   the   recovery   they’re   in.   
150-year-old   luxury   retailer   De   Bijenkorf   turned   to   local   insights   and   automation   to   speed   up   
cross-border   expansion   beyond   the   Netherlands   and   Belgium   to   Germany,   France,   and   Austria.   
With   a   multi-pronged   approach,   including   Shopping   Campaigns,   De   Bijenkorf   drove   substantial   
growth   throughout   the   pandemic.   Returning   visitors   to   online   stores   were   up   fourfold   in   first-half   
2021   vs.   2020.   
  
Which   leads   me   to   retail   –   where   we   had   another   stellar   quarter.   We’ve   seen   explosive   growth   
in   digital   over   the   last   20-some   months,   but   as   the   world   begins   to   reopen,   shoppers   are   
returning   to   stores.   Brick   and   mortar   isn’t   dead   –   instead,   omnichannel   is   in   full   force.   Searches   
for   ‘open   now   near   me’   are   up   four   times   globally   vs.   last   year.   Strong   growth   in   local   shopping   
queries   means   people   are   researching   their   visits   to   stores   more   often   before   they   go.   As   a   
result,   we’ve   seen   more   advertisers   include   in-store   sales   alongside   ecommerce   goals   to   drive   
omnichannel   growth   –   adoption   has   nearly   doubled   over   the   past   year.   Take   Kohl’s   -   it   optimized   
media   spend   into   trending   categories   and   launched   curbside   pickup   just   two   weeks   after   its   
1,100   stores   shut   down.   After   testing   Local   Inventory   Ads   in   Q4,   Kohl’s   went   all   in   on   
omnichannel   bidding   across   its   paid   Search   portfolio   and   is   leaning   heavily   into   a   full-funnel   
approach   on   YouTube   –   including   CTV.   Kohl’s   net   sales   were   up   31%   year   over   year   in   Q2,   led   
by   higher   foot   traffic   and   continued   strength   in   digital.     
  
Innovating   in   omnichannel   and   next-gen   user   experiences   remains   core   to   our   shopping   
strategy.   A   few   of   our   latest   launches   include:   easier   ways   for   businesses   to   show   the   local   
services   they   offer   –   from   hair   extensions   to   auto   repair   –   across   Search   and   Maps.   Local   
inventory   ads   that   highlights   which   products   are   in-stock   and   when   to   pick   them   up.   Free   
shipping   and   easy   return   annotations   across   Search   and   Shopping.   AR   capabilities   that   bring   
in-store   moments   online   and   let   users   try   before   they   buy.   And   then   –   instantly   shoppable   
images   with   Google   Lens.   Plus   a   new   visual,   browseable   experience   on   Search.     
  
There’s   a   lot   more   to   come…including   tapping   into   commerce   on   YouTube.   From   shoppable   
livestream   experiments   with   retailers   like   Sephora,   Target   and   Walmart   to   pilots   that   let   viewers   
buy   directly   from   their   favorite   creators’   videos,   we’re   still   in   the   early   innings   of   what’s   possible.

Our   direct   response   momentum   remains   strong.   Video   Action   Campaigns   are   driving   more   
conversions   than   previous   formats,   and   by   adding   product   feeds   to   these   campaigns,   
advertisers   are   achieving,   on   average,   over   60%   more   conversions   at   a   lower   cost   than   those   
without.     
  
Our   brand   business   is   also   performing   well.   As   I   said   last   quarter,   YouTube’s   reach   is   becoming   
increasingly   incremental   to   TV   –   we’re   helping   advertisers   find   audiences   they   can’t   find   
anywhere   else.   Connected   TV   is   driving   part   of   this   growth   –   it’s   our   fastest   growing   screen.   The   
precision   of   digital   paired   with   the   scale   of   linear   is   proving   to   be   an   awesome   combo   –   and   
even   more   so   now   with   the   expansion   of   Video   Action   Campaigns   for   CTV.   Advertisers   can   now   
drive   conversions   on   the   big   screen.   
  
Which   brings   me   to   how   brands   of   all   sizes   continue   to   buy   YouTube   at   both   ends   of   the   funnel   -   
to   create   future   demand   while   they   convert   existing   demand.   And   they’re   seeing   upside.   For   
example,   we   found   that   advertisers   using   both   DR   and   Brand   video   see   Brand   driving   28%   of   
conversion   assists.   Domino's   Pizza   is   a   great   example   –   their   UK   business   delivered   a   9X   return   
on   ad   spend   on   their   direct   response   campaigns   when   paired   with   their   brand   campaigns.   
  
Lastly,   I’ve   said   it   before   and   I’ll   say   it   again   –   our   success   is   only   possible   because   of   our   
customers   and   partners.   We   do   well   only   when   they   do   well   –   and   it’s   a   result   of   the   revenue   
share   models   we’ve   talked   about   many   times   before.     
  
Three   highlights:   first,   as   Sundar   mentioned,   our   commitment   to   high-quality   journalism   and   
open   access   to   information   remains   steadfast.   It’s   been   one   year   since   we   launched   News   
Showcase   –   in   Q3   alone,   we   signed   over   120   deals   and   launched   in   3   new   markets   –   Japan,   
Colombia,   and   Austria.   And   of   the   more   than   1,000   publications   across   a   dozen-plus   countries   
that   we   now   have   on   board,   90%   are   considered   local,   regional   or   community   newspapers.   
  
Second,   over   2   million   creators   are   now   making   money   and   building   their   businesses   on   
YouTube   via   our   YouTube   Partner   Program   –   with   10   different   ways   to   monetize   their   content,   
from   Super   Chat   to   Brand   Connect.   The   next   generation   of   businesses   and   media   companies   
are   being   built   by   creators,   on   YouTube   –   and   we’re   excited   to   help   them   grow.   
  
Third,   I   echo   Sundar’s   excitement   on   Pixel.   And   to   bring   it   to   life,   and   to   users,   we   worked   with   
an   entire   ecosystem   of   partners.   We   signed   partnership   agreements   with   over   45   carriers   and   
retailers   across   nine   countries   at   launch   –   including   deep   collaboration   with   each   of   the   major   
US   carriers:   AT&T,   T-Mobile,   and   Verizon.     
  
On   behalf   of   many,   I   want   to   say   how   grateful   we   are   to   collaborate   with   so   many   amazing   
customers   and   partners   every   day   –   we   can’t   wait   to   start   doing   more   of   this   in   person   again   
soon.   Also,   a   huge   “thank   you”   to   our   sales,   partnerships,   product   and   support   teams   for   their   
work   and   dedication   -   the   impact   you   all   continue   to   have   is,   as   we   say   in   German,   “wunderbar!”   
With   that,   Ruth,   over   to   you.     
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thank   you,   Philipp.   Our   revenue   performance   in   the   
third   quarter   reflects   continued   broad-based   strength   in   advertiser   spend   and   elevated   
consumer   online   activity   as   well   as   a   strong   contribution   from   Google   Cloud.   My   comments   will   
be   on   year-over-year   comparisons   for   the   third   quarter,   unless   I   state   otherwise.   We   will   start   
with   results   at   the   Alphabet   level,   followed   by   segment   results,   and   conclude   with   our   outlook.     
  
5   
For   the   third   quarter,   our   Consolidated   Revenues   were   $65.1   billion,   up   41%,   or   up   39%   in   
constant   currency.   Our   total   cost   of   revenues   was   $27.6   billion,   up   31%,   primarily   driven   by   
growth   in   TAC,   which   was   $11.5   billion,   up   41%.   Other   Cost   of   Revenues,   were   $16.1   billion,   up   
24%,   reflecting   in   part   the   benefit   from   the   change   in   useful   lives   made   earlier   this   year.   The   
largest   driver   of   the   growth   in   Other   Cost   of   Revenues   was   content   acquisition   costs.   Operating   
expenses   were   $16.5   billion,   up   19%.   In   terms   of   the   three   component   parts   of   opex.   First,   the   
increase   in   R&D   expenses   was   driven   primarily   by   headcount   growth.   Second,   the   growth   in   
Sales   &   Marketing   expenses   was   driven   by   headcount   growth,   followed   by   the   continued   
ramp-up   of   spending   on   ads   and   promo,   in   contrast   to   the   pullback   in   the   third   quarter   last   year.   
Finally,   the   increase   in   G&A   reflects   the   impact   of   charges   relating   to   legal   matters,   followed   by   
headcount   growth.   Operating   income   was   $21.0   billion,   up   88%   and   our   operating   margin    was   
32%.   Other   Income   &   Expense,   was   $2.0   billion,   which   primarily   reflects   unrealized   gains   in   the   
value   of   investments   in   equity   securities.   Net   income   was   $18.9   billion.     
  
We   continued   to   generate   strong   Free   Cash   Flow   of   $18.7   billion   in   the   quarter   and   $65.7   billion   
for   the   trailing   twelve   months.   We   ended   the   third   quarter   with   $142   billion   in   cash   and   
marketable   securities.     
  
Let   me   now   turn   to   our   segment   financial   results.   Starting   with   our   Google   Services   segment,   
total   Google   Services   Revenues   were   $59.9   billion,   up   41%.   Google   search   and   other   
advertising   revenues   of   $37.9   billion   in   the   quarter,   were   up   44%,   with   broad-based   strength   
across   our   business,   led   again   by   strong   growth   in   retail.   YouTube   advertising   revenues   of   $7.2   
billion,   were   up   43%,   due   to   strength   in   both   direct   response   and   brand   advertising.   The   
deceleration   in   the   growth   rate   vs   the   second   quarter   was   driven   by   lapping   a   strong   recovery   in   
brand   in   the   third   quarter   of   last   year.   Network   advertising   revenues   of   $8.0   billion,   were   up   
40%.   Other   Revenues   were   $6.8   billion,   up   23%,   driven   by   growth   in   YouTube   non-advertising   
revenues;   and   Hardware,   which   benefited   from   the   addition   of   Fitbit   revenues.   Google   Services   
Operating   income   was   $24.0   billion,   up   66%,   and   the   operating   margin   was   40%.     
  
Turning   to   the   Google   Cloud   segment,   revenues   were   $5.0   billion   for   the   third   quarter,   up   45%.   
GCP’s   revenue   growth   was   again   above   Cloud   overall,   reflecting   significant   growth   in   both   
infrastructure   and   platform   services.   Strong   revenue   growth   in   Google   Workspace   was   driven   by   
robust   growth   in   both   seats   and   average   revenue   per   seat.   Google   Cloud   had   an   Operating   
Loss   of   $644   million.   
  
As   to   our   Other   Bets,   in   the   third   quarter,   revenues   were   $182   million.   The   operating   loss   was   
$1.3   billion.   
  
Let   me   close   with   some   comments   on   our   outlook.   With   respect   to   foreign   exchange   impact   on   
reported   revenues,   based   on   current   spot   rates   we   expect   virtually   no   impact   in   Q4   in   contrast   
to   a   1.5%   tailwind   in   Q3   and   4%   in   Q2.   
  
In   terms   of   outlook   by   segment,   for   Google   Services   –   as   I   noted,   the   strength   of   our   revenues   
in   Q3   reflected   both   underlying   strength   in   advertiser   and   user   activity   as   well   as   the   impact   
from   lapping   weaker   performance   in   the   comparable   period   last   year.   Given   the   gradual   
recovery   in   results   through   the   back   half   of   2020,   the   benefit   from   lapping   prior   year   
performance   diminished   in   Q3   vs   Q2   and   will   diminish   further   in   Q4.   
  
Within   Other   Revenues,   in   the   fourth   quarter,   we   expect   the   ongoing   drivers   of   revenue   growth   
to   be   Hardware,   due   to   the   benefit   from   the   holiday   selling   season   and   inclusion   of   Fitbit,   as   well   
as   YouTube   subscriptions.   Google   Play’s   contribution   to   revenue   growth   will   remain   more   muted   
6   
given   the   ongoing   impact   of   both   lapping   the   increased   level   of   user   engagement   that   started   in   
the   first   quarter   of   2020   due   to   the   pandemic,   as   well   as   the   fee   change   that   took   effect   on   July   
1.   
  
Within   Google   Services,   we   expect   Sales   and   Marketing   expenses   to   be   elevated   in   the   fourth   
quarter   to   support   the   holiday   season.   
  
Turning   to   Google   Cloud,   we   remain   focused   on   revenue   growth,   and   are   pleased   with   the   
trends   we   are   seeing.   In   GCP,   our   customer   wins,   as   Sundar   noted,   reflect   our   multi-year   
investments   in   products   and   solutions   that   are   purpose-built   to   solve   for   the   biggest   
opportunities   within   our   targeted   eight   industries.   The   benefit   of   these   solutions   to   our   
customers   is   clear   and   they   are   choosing   to   work   with   us   as   their   long-term   transformation   
partner.   With   respect   to   Workspace,   we   are   pleased   with   the   ongoing   momentum   in   both   seat   
growth   and   average   revenue   per   seat,   which   underscores   the   value   of   collaborative   solutions,   in   
particular   as   people   increasingly   are   embracing   a   hybrid   work   model.   Across   Cloud,   we   
continue   to   invest   aggressively,   both   in   growing   our   Go-to-Market   and   product   teams   as   well   as   
building   out   our   cloud   regions.     
  
At   the   Alphabet   level,   headcount   grew   by   nearly   6,000   in   the   third   quarter,   including   our   
seasonal   campus   hires,   and   we   expect   robust   headcount   growth   in   Q4   for   both   Google   Services   
and   Google   Cloud.   
  
Turning   to   CapEx,   the   results   in   the   third   quarter   primarily   reflect   ongoing   investment   in   our   
technical   infrastructure,   most   notably   in   servers,   to   support   ongoing   growth   in   Google   Services   
and   Google   Cloud.   We   also   continue   to   increase   the   pace   of   investment   in   fit-outs   and   
ground-up   construction   of   office   facilities   to   accommodate   our   ongoing   headcount   growth   
globally.   We   will   continue   to   pursue   real   estate   acquisition   opportunities   where   it   makes   sense,   
as   you   saw   in   our   New   York   City   announcement   in   Q3.   Thank   you.   And   now   Sundar,   Philipp   and   
I   will   take   your   questions.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   As   a   reminder,   to   ask   a   question,   you'll   need   to   press   star   one   on   your   
telephone.   To   withdraw   your   question,   please   press   the   pound   key.   To   prevent   any   background   
noise,   we   ask   that   you   please   mute   your   line   once   your   question   has   been   stated.   And   our   first   
question   comes   from   Eric   Sheridan,   from   Goldman   Sachs.   Your   line   is   now   open.   
  
Eric   Sheridan,   Goldman   Sachs :    Thank   you   very   much   for   taking   the   questions.   Maybe   first   
one   for   Sundar,   big   picture.   Coming   back   to   how   you   started   the   call,   when   you   look   out   over   
the   next   three   to   five   years,   what   do   you   see   as   some   of   the   big   investments   that   Google   needs   
to   make   to   marry   your   ambitions   on   AI   and   machine   learning   against   aligning   Google's   broader   
product   and   services   against   the   rising   digitalization   of   the   global   economy.   Would   love   to   have   
that   as   a   framing   over   the   next   three   to   five   years.   And   then   maybe   --   I'm   not   sure   if   it's   directed   
better   at   Philipp   or   Ruth,   but   on   a   shorter-duration   basis,   there   seemed   to   be   an   element   of   
headwinds   and   tailwinds   in   the   broader   macro   economy.   Can   you   talk   a   little   bit   about   the   
business   elements   of   Google's   products   and   what   elements   of   reopening   dynamic   you're   
seeing   on   a   sector   basis   versus   potential   headwinds   as   we   move   into   Q4   next   year   from   things   
like   supply   chain   shortages   or   labor   shortages   or   things   like   that.   Thanks   so   much   in   advance   
for   the   color.     
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Eric,   great   question.   You're   right   in   the   fact   that   AI   
and   ML   itself   is   the   broader,   deeper   investments   we   are   driving,   and   we   are   using   it   across   our   
product   portfolio.   
7   
The   recent   launch   of   Tensor   and   Pixel   6   is   a   great   example   of   that.   So,   for   example,   we   are   
willing   to   go   as   deep   in   the   stack   as   needed,   silicon,   both   on   the   cloud   side   with   our   Tensor   
Processing   Units,   and   Google   Tensor   on   the   client   side   is   an   example   of   that.   So   overall,   
thinking   through   compute,   networking,   building   data   centers,   making   sure   they   are   clean   and   
carbon   free,   and   really   investing   in,   you   know,   the   advanced   models   and   algorithms   on   top,   
which   is,   a   lot   of   it,   done   by   our   AI   research   teams.   So   making   sure   we   are   able   to   attract   the   
best   talent   across   the   world   is   all   part   of   that.   But   you   will   continue   to   see   us   undertake   deep   
technology   investments.   And   beyond   that   horizon,   that's   why   we   are   thinking   even   about   areas   
like   quantum   computing   and   so   on.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    So   to   the   second   part   of   your   question,   we   
continue   to   watch   countries   as   vaccination   rates   climb   and   local   regulations   ease.   We   expect   
some   amount   of   heterogeneity   in   recovery,   depending,   obviously,   on   location   and   vaccination   
rates.   But   because   every   region   is   different,   it's   hard   to   make   a   generalization   from   the   data   
right   now.   That   said,   the   consumer   shift   to   digital   is   real   and   will   continue,   even   as   we   start   
seeing   people   return   to   stores.   Shopping   habits   have   ebbed   and   flowed   over   the   last   20   
months.   But   the   underlying   takeaway   is   that   people   want   more   choice,   they   want   more   
information,   more   flexibility.   And   we   don't   see   this   reversing.   
  
Omnichannel,   I   talked   about   it,   is   definitely   in   full   force.   I   said   this   earlier.   We've   been   really   
focused   on   building   features   and   solutions   to   help   retailers,   large   and   small,   succeed   here.   And   
we   think   this   will   continue   as   the   world   re-opens   and   shoppers   fluctuate   between   online   and   
in-store   based   on   whatever   is   really   more   convenient.  
  
YouTube   is   exciting   for   many   reasons.   It's   incredible   to   see   the   amount   of   content   that's   
valuable   for   people   across   so   many   topics.   And   we're   helping   advertisers   tap   into   this.   And   
whether   it's   browsing   for   inspiration,   product   research,   or   actually   making   the   purchase,   a   billion   
shopping   sessions   happen   across   Google   every   day,   and   they're   happening   on   Search   and   
YouTube   and   Image   Search   and   the   Shopping   tab   and   Lens,   and   so   on.   So,   frankly,   we're   really   
encouraged   by   the   long-term   opportunity   in   commerce.   And   we're   laser-focused   on   helping   
businesses   of   all   sizes   connect   with   their   customers   wherever   they   are.     
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Brian   Nowak   from   Morgan   Stanley.   
Your   line   is   now   open.     
  
Brenda   Duverce,   Morgan   Stanley:    Hi,   it's   Brenda   on   for   Brian.   Thanks   for   taking   our   
questions.   We   have   two.   The   first   one:   you   have   made   notable   strides   in   the   retail   search   
category   over   the   past   12   to   18   months,   and   there   seems   to   be   more   to   come.   Can   you   talk   to   
us   about   which   other   Search   verticals   –   where   you   are   most   excited   to   innovate   and   invest   
around   the   next   –   within   the   next   year   or   two?   My   second   question   is   maybe   one   on   augmented   
reality.   You   have   made   some   real   progress   here   and   now   have   some   budding   product   
integrations.   Philosophically,   how   do   you   think   about   the   key   augmented   reality   use   cases   you   
are   focused   on   enabling?   And   do   you   need   an   Alphabet-specific   hardware   set   to   capitalize   on   
the   opportunity?   Thank   you.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Maybe   I'll   take   the   second   one   first.   You   know,   in   
augmented   reality,   we   have   --   for   a   while,   we   have   deeply   focused   on,   you   know,   thinking   
through   computing   for   the   long   term.   We've   talked   about   ambient   computing,   and   it's   just   a   
matter   of   time   before,   beyond   phones,   you   will   see   other   successful   form   factors.   And   AR   is   an   
exciting   part   of   that   future.

We   are   looking   at   all   the   deep   investments   we   need   to   make.   I   think   it's   going   to   take   some   
time.   And   so,   for   example,   when   you   look   at   something   like   Google   Lens   or   when   you   look   at   
the   fact   that   we   are   making   Search   work   in   a   multimodal   way   or   when   you   think   about   YouTube   
and   making   sure   it   works   well   in   a   VR/AR   world,   so   we   are   obviously   investing   in   all   our   
services.   And   beyond   that,   from   a   computing   standpoint,   both,   you   know,   both   our   Hardware   
teams   as   well   as   our   platform   teams   are   thinking   through,   definitely,   and   it's   going   to   be   a   major  
area   of   investment   for   us.     
  
On   the   first   question   about   --   I   think   Philipp   spoke   about   shopping.   We   obviously   --   you   know,   
Search   is   --   part   of   what   makes   Search   so   successful   is   people   use   it   for   a   wide   variety   of   use   
cases.   And   so   we   really   invest   comprehensively   across   all   experiences,   be   it   local   in   Maps,   be   
it   images,   be   it   videos.   And   so   we   are   definitely   investing   a   lot.   People   do   come   to   Search   for   
education   as   well.   So,   you   know,   making   sure   we   are   comprehensive.   Health   has   been   a   major   
area   of   focus,   particularly   through   the   pandemic.   And   so   the   strength   of   Search   is   both   in   its   
depth   and   breadth.   And   so   --   and   getting   it   right,   with   a   high   focus   on   quality.   And   we'll   continue   
to   do   that.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Doug   Anmuth   from   JP   Morgan.     
Your   line   is   now   open.   
  
Doug   Anmuth,   JP   Morgan:    Thanks   for   taking   the   questions.   I   have   two.   First,   I   was   just   
curious   if   you're   seeing   any   impact   at   all   from   the   Apple   iOS   changes   in   your   business   and   
perhaps   particularly   in   YouTube.   And   then   second,   given   retail,   the   biggest   driver   of   services   
growth,   and,   of   course,   you're   really   just   touching   all   parts   of   the   economy,   any   more   
commentary   on   how   you're   thinking   about   supply   and   labor   shortage   dynamics   in   the   fourth   
quarter   and   if   you're   perhaps   seeing   anything   thus   far   there?   Thank   you.   
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thanks   for   the   question.   Starting   with   the   iOS   14   
changes.   So,   overall,   as   we've   said,   we're   pleased   with   the   strength   across   our   business.   In   the   
third   quarter,   it   was   broad-based,   it   was   global.   In   terms   of   the   iOS   14   changes   specifically,   they   
had   a   modest   impact   on   YouTube   revenues   –   that   was   primarily   in   direct   response.   I   think,   as   
you   all   know   well,   focusing   on   privacy   has   been   core   to   what   we've   been   doing   consistently.   
And   let   me   have   Philipp   take   you   through   some   more   on   that.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Yeah.   So   from   our   standpoint,   we   see   ATT   as   one   
aspect   of   the   many   broader   ecosystem   changes   that   are   underway.   And   we've   been   investing   
in   privacy-preserving   technology   for   many   years.   Our   focus   is   on   supporting   developers,   small   
and   large   advertisers,   creators,   publishers   so   that   they're   able   to   mitigate   impact   to   their   
businesses.   And   we   really   see   the   future   of   digital   advertising   being   built   on   advances   in   
privacy-preserving   on-device   technologies   which   support   the   free   and   open   Internet   and,   
obviously,   a   robust   ads   ecosystem.   
  
On   your   supply   chain   questions,   I   would   say   performance   in   Q3   was   strong   across   ads   revenue   
lines,   regions,   and   nearly   all   verticals.   In   line   with   the   widespread   reporting   of   supply   chain   
weakness   in   the   auto   industry,   we've   seen   some   impact   on   vehicles   within   the   auto   vertical,   
which   started   earlier   in   the   year,   although   the   impact   has   really   been   offset   somewhat   by   
increased   demand   in   related   areas,   like   parts,   accessories,   repairs   and   maintenance.     
  
Doug   Anmuth,   JP   Morgan:    Great.   Thank   you.

Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Justin   Post   from   Bank   of   America.   
Your   line   is   now   open.   
  
Justin   Post,   Bank   of   America   Merrill   Lynch:    Thank   you.   One   for   Sundar   and   one   for   Ruth.   
Sundar,   margins   have   been   strong   this   year,   and   I   think   the   depreciation   changes   helped.   Can   
you   just   comment   on   how   you   see   the   current   investing   spending   levels   of   the   company?   Are   
you   in   good   shape?   You   know,   anything   where   you   might   be   increasing   investment?   And   then   
for   Ruth,   there   -   news   about   Play   Store   fee   cuts   on   the   subscription   piece,   how   do   we   think   
about   that   maybe   impacting   the   business   in   '22,   when   those   start   to   take   effect?   Thank   you.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    You   know,   at   a   high   level,   look,   I   mean,   I've   taken   
a   long-term   view.   And   we   are   obviously   investing   both   in   foundational   technologies   like   AI   and   
just   deep   --   deeper   computer   science   overall   and   applying   it   across   a   prioritized   set   of   areas.   
And   so   no   change   in   the   framework.   If   anything,   I   do   feel,   with   the   digital   transformation   
underway,   if   anything,   we   feel   a   sense   of   urgency   to   execute   against   the   opportunities   we   see.   
So   still   --   still   working   within   the   long-term   framework.   Maybe   Ruth   and   Philipp?   
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Yeah,   if   I   can   just   add   on   –   on   the   margin   –   and   go   to   
your   second   part   of   the   question,   just   a   bit   of   context   on   the   third   quarter   here.   An   important   
point,   hopefully   self-evident,   is   that   the   improvement   in   the   Q3   operating   margin   does   reflect   the   
strong   revenue   growth   in   the   quarter.     
  
And   as   I   said   on   the   second   quarter   call,   some   of   our   costs   are   less   variable   in   the   short   term,   
such   as   depreciation   and   the   operations   costs   of   our   data   centers.   And   we   did   have   a   gross   
margin   benefit   from   this   in   the   near   term.   But   consistent   with   Sundar's   comments   and   Philipp's,   
we   do   continue   to   invest   here.   
  
And   then   to   support   long-term   growth   across   both   Google   Services   and   Google   Cloud,   we're   
continuing   to   invest   at   a   meaningful   clip   across   headcount,   compute,   sales   and   marketing.   You   
know,   I   noted   the   headcount   increase   in   Q3   of   about   6,000.   And   we   do   expect   the   pace   of   
hiring   to   remain   strong.     
  
The   benefit   from   the   change   in   useful   lives   was   obviously   in   the   quarter   as   well.   And   that   
benefit   does   diminish,   is   lower   in   the   fourth   quarter.   So   just   to   put   some   of   that   in   context.   And   
as   Sundar   said,   we   are   continuing   to   invest   in   the   business,   focusing   on   long-term   growth.   
  
With   respect   to   the   Play   changes,   again,   just   as   it   relates   to   this   quarter,   and   I   think   as   I   said   in   
opening   comments,   the   key   point   to   note   there   was   that   results   lapped,   you   know,   the   strength   
that   we   had   in   the   --   going   into   the   pandemic   from   user   engagement.   And   that   continues,   
seeing   user   engagement.   But,   yes,   there   is   a   reduction   in   the   fee   that   kicks   in.   The   one   that   we   
just   announced   last   week,   it   kicks   in   as   of   January   2022.   And   we'll   let   you   do   the   modeling   on   
that.     
  
Justin   Post,   Bank   of   America   Merrill   Lynch:    Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Mark   Mahaney   from   ISI.   Your   line   is   
now   open.   
  
Mark   Mahaney,   Evercore   ISI:    Thanks.   Two   questions.   Is   there   anything   that   suggests   that   
some   of   these   ATT   headwinds   for   other   people   in   the   industry   actually   cause   shifts   in   budget   
over   to   your   platforms,   your   different   platforms?   That's   for   Philipp.   And   then,   Ruth,   just   on   the   
10   
margins,   is   there   anything   other   than   revenue   overage,   that   really   strong   revenue   performance,   
flowing   against   fixed   costs   and   the   extended   depreciation   schedules   that's   causing   those   
margins   to   rise?   Or   have   you   been   able   to,   you   know,   work   out,   eke   out,   tweak   out,   new   
efficiencies   in   the   model   itself?   Thank   you   very   much.   
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    So   why   don't   I   start   on   that.   The   key   point,   as   I   said,   
is,   it   starts   with   strong   revenue   growth   and   just   timing   lags.   Some   of   the   costs,   as   I   said,   are,   
you   know,   kind   of   more   fixed   in   the   near   term.   But   we   do   continue   to   invest.   And   you   can   see   
that   in   gross   margin.   You   can   see   it   in   operating   margin.   And   we   are   continuing   to   --   to   invest   to   
support   growth   we   see   in   both   Google   Services   and   Google   Cloud.   
  
You   know,   in   up-leveling   the   question,   we've   consistently   said   --   our   focus   in   capital   allocation   is   
investing   for   long-term   growth   and   innovation   and   making   sure   that   we   remain   focused   on   that,   
those   long-term   opportunities.     
  
At   the   same   time,   we've   consistently   also   said   that   it's   important   to   ensure   that   we're   being   
sharp   about   investments   within   each   product   area.   And   we're   continuing   to   do   that,   and   we're   
continuing   to   focus   on   investing   in   what   we   call   operational   excellence   to   ensure   we   can   deliver   
for   all   of   our   stakeholders   in   a   high-quality   way.   And   that   includes   all   of   our   efforts   around   
privacy,   security,   and   content   moderation.   So   you're   seeing   us   continue   to   invest   there.   A   bit   of   
puts   and   takes.   We're   trying   to   ensure   that   we're   setting   up   all   of   the   areas   to   deliver   for   
long-term   high-quality   performance   and   results.     
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    You   know,   on   the   first   question   around   ad   
budgets   and   shift   and   stuff,   I   don't   think   there's   anything   notable   that   we   have   observed   to   
comment   on.     
  
Mark   Mahaney,   Evercore   ISI:    Thank   you   very   much.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Brent   Thill   from   Jefferies.   Your   line   is   
now   open.   
  
Brent   Thill,   Jefferies:    Thanks.   On   Google   Cloud,   we   continue   to   hear   from   the   partners   that   
the   deal   size   is   building,   and   BigQuery   is   having   a   big   impact   for   a   lot   of   your   customers.   Can   
you   just   talk   to   and   expand   on   what   you're   seeing   there,   and   any   other   noticeable   trends   that   
you're   seeing   now   that   maybe   you   hadn't   seen   in   the   past.   Thank   you.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Well,   thanks.   Look,   overall,   you   know,   we   
continue   to   see   strong   momentum.   The   team   is   executing   well.   You   mentioned   BigQuery.   Data   
and   analytics   and   AI   continues   to   be   a   kind   of   a   foundational   shift   for   what   companies   are   trying   
to   accomplish,   and   BigQuery   does   stand   out   there.   And   we   are   definitely   seeing,   you   know,   
continued   momentum   there.   It's   a   source   of   strength.   
  
The   other   areas   I   would   highlight   are,   security   continues   to   be   an   increasing   area   of   focus   and   
a   differentiator   for   us,   given   over   two   decades   of   investment   we   have   had.   We've   pioneered   
zero   trust   and   so   on.   So   as   cybersecurity   elevates   in   concern   across   companies   I   talk   to,   and   
the   CEOs,   it's   definitely   been   an   area.   Multi-cloud   continues   to   be   a   differentiator.   I   do   think   
customers   are   increasingly   looking   for   it.   And   we've   embraced   it   from   early   on,   so   that   is   an   
area   as   well.     
  
11   
But   above   all,   I   think   we   are   very,   very   focused   on   industry   value   propositions,   so   really   
sharpening   our   solutions   by   vertical.   And   that's   --   that's   really   helped   us,   you   know,   get   some   of   
the   bigger   deals   you   mention   as   well.   And   we'll   continue   doing   that.     
  
Brent   Thill,   Jefferies:    Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Michael   Nathanson   from   Moffett   
Nathanson.   Your   line   is   now   open.   
  
Michael   Nathanson,   MoffettNathanson:    Thanks.   I   have   one   for   Sundar   and   then   one   for   
Philipp.   Sundar,   you   talked   earlier   about   the   JioPhone   Next   and   the   launch   next   week   in   India.   
I   wonder   if   you   can   talk   about   the   longer   term   opportunity   for   Alphabet   in   India,   you   know,   from   
opening   up   that   product.   And   any   type   of   time   frame   when   you   think   you   will   see   maybe   the   
benefits   of   what   you're   doing   on   the   low   price   phone   there.   
  
And   then   for   Philipp,   it   just   seems   longer   term   as   mobile   targeting   becomes   more   difficult   due   to   
all   these   privacy   changes   that   there   has   to   be   a   mix   shift   in   budgets.   I   wonder   how   do   you   think   
the   value   proposition   of   Search   will   change   going   forward?   And   what   can   you   do,   even   more   
than   you've   done   before,   to   take   advantage   of   what   looks   like   real   challenges   in   the   ability   to   
target   and   measure   when   it   comes   to   mobile   search   --   I   mean   when   it   comes   to   mobile   --   
mobile   advertising?   Thanks.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    You   know,   on   India,   thanks   for   the   question.   
Look,   I   think   obviously   the   pandemic   has   been   hard,   but   through   it   all,   you   know,   people   are   
looking   for   access,   and   there   has   definitely   been   a   wave   of   people   who   have   adopted   
smartphones,   and   there   is   still   --   we   see   the   demand   for   people   looking   to   shift   from   feature   
phones   to   smartphones.   And   so   part   of   what   excites   me   about   the   upcoming   partnership   with   
Jio   in   building   a   phone   is   –   really   investing   beyond   just   English   and   getting   languages   and   
getting   the   local   needs   right   for   people,   and   doing   it   in   a   way   that   many   more   people   can   take   
advantages   of   a   smartphone.   
  
So   I   view   it   as   laying   the   foundation.   You   know,   it's   a   version   of   digital   transformation,   and   it's  
palpable,   the   demand   we   see.   And,   you   know,   I   think   over   a   three-   to   five-year   time   frame,   it   will   
end   up   having   a   lot   of   impact.     
  
But   overall,   India,   just   like   Asia   Pacific,   continues   to   be   an   exciting   market   for   us.   We   see   
strength   across   the   categories   we   are   involved   in,   and   so   you'll   continue   to   see   us   stay   focused   
there.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    And   to   the   second   part   of   your   question,   look,   as   I   
said,   we   see   the   future   of   digital   advertising   being   built   on   advances   in   privacy-preserving   
on-device   technologies.   This   is   a   big   area   that   we've   invested   already   and   that   we   are   going   to   
invest   in   even   more.   
  
And   as   far   as   how   we   think   about   our   runway   for   growth,   we   really   think   about   improving   user   
and   advertiser   experience   for   years   and   years   to   come,   and   we're   always   asking   ourselves   the   
same   questions,   right?   How   do   we   drive   better   answers   to   queries,   especially   on   Search,   
especially   including   those   with   commercial   intent.   How   do   you   use   machine   learning   to   deliver   
even   more   relevant   and   higher-quality   experiences   for   users   that   then   drive   higher   clicks   and   
more   conversions   for   advertisers.   
  
12   
So   really   our   main   goal   is   to   consistently   deliver   great   experiences   for   our   users,   drive   
incremental   value   for   our   partners,   and   making   them   successful.   And   as   long   as   we   do   this   and   
we   continue   to   invest   in   the   privacy-preserving   technology   as   I   mentioned,   we   should   continue   
to   see   budgets   move   our   way.   
  
Michael   Nathanson,   MoffettNathanson:    Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Ross   Sandler   from   Barclays.   Your   
line   is   now   open.   
  
Ross   Sandler,   Barclays:    Hey,   guys.   I   just   had   a   high-level   question   on   YouTube.   So   you're   
obviously   doing   really   well   there,   and   as   large   as   it   is   and   as   high   as   the   engagement   is   
compared   to   just   about   any   other   app   that   we   see   across   the   broader   Internet,   the   revenue   at   
just   around   $30   billion   this   year   pales   in   comparison   to,   you   know,   core   Facebook   or   Instagram.     
So   do   you   think   that,   you   know,   this   is,   obviously,   a   huge   opportunity   for   YouTube,   especially   
with   Connected   TV?    Is   there   something   that   you   guys   need   to   change   about   your   approach   
with   either   direct   sales   or   kind   of   decoupling   Search   from   YouTube   and   some   of   the   other   
products   that   Google   has   under   the   same   roof,   or   do   you   kind   of   think   continuing   along   the   
same   path   is   the   right   strategy   for   YouTube   specifically?    Any   color   on   that   would   be   helpful.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Look,   I   think,   you   know,   obviously   YouTube   is   
unique   in   the   sense   that   it's   a   true   video-native,   video-first   product   from   day   one,   and   so   you   
are   dealing   with   a   new   form.   And   obviously   as   a   company,   I   think   we   have   taken   a   long-term   
view,   which   is   why   you   see   the   engagement   on   the   product.   It's   working   at   scale.   Content   
responsibility   has   been   our   most   important   focus   for   the   past   many   years.   
  
And   beyond   that,   I   think   we   worked   hard   to   make   sure   both   creators   can   do   well   and,   you   know,   
it's   a   great   platform   for   advertisers.   We've   had   strength   in   brand.   We've   built   on   it   with   robust   
momentum   in   direct   response.   There's   obviously,   you   know,   newer   opportunities   such   as   
shopping   which   we   are   investing   in.   And   Shorts   represents   an   additional   early   but   important   
area   for   us   from   an   investment   and   a   growth   standpoint.   So   I   –   I   feel   the   fundamentals   of   the   
platform   are   strong,   and   with   the   long-term   view,   I   see   this   as   an   area   where   we   have   more   
upside.   And   so   we'll   continue   our   investments   with   that   in   mind.     
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   next   question   comes   from   Colin   Sebastian   from   Baird.   Your   line   
is   now   open.   
  
Colin   Sebastian,   Baird:    Thank   you.   A   couple   of   big-picture   questions.   Sundar,   first   off   looking   
at   GCP   and   some   of   the   innovations   you've   talked   about   like   distributed   cloud,   I   just   wonder   
what   you   think   the   long-term   future   is   for   hybrid   cloud   environments.   Are   they   really   --   or   is   this   
just   really   a   part   of   the   process   or   stepping   stones   to   bring   more   companies   or   most   companies   
over   to   full   cloud   adoption?   
  
And   then,   secondly,   we're   seeing   a   clear   blurring   of   the   lines   among   eCommerce,   digital   
payments   and   social   platforms.   So   I   was   hoping   you   could   share   the   vision   for   Google   and   
YouTube   and   the   other   Google   apps   in   this   context,   how   those   pieces   fit   together   as   a   closed   
loop   shopping   platform,   if   that's   the   right   way   to   think   about   it.   Thank   you.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    You   know,   to   your   first   question   on   GCP,   part   of   
our   strength   is,   you   know,   we   have   taken   a   very   open   and   scalable   and   flexible   approach,   and,   
you   know,   we   don't   view   it   as   a   one   size   fits   all.   So   we   want   to   meet   the   customers   the   way   they   
13   
want   to   take   this   journey   and   I   think   are   gearing   up   to   support   them   both   from   a   multi-cloud,   
from   a   hybrid   cloud   standpoint.   
  
But   I   do   think   --   you   know,   I   do   think   over   time,   you   know,   when   I   look   at   the   scale   at   which   we   
are   investing   to   support,   particularly   to   my   points   earlier   around   security   and   so   on,   I   think   
people   will   see   the   value,   more,   of   a   hosted   cloud   solution.   But   I   think   we   --   you   know,   I   think   
we   want   to   be   customer-centric   here,   and,   then,   you   know,   we   want   to   go   where   the   market   
goes.   And   that's   why   we've   built   --   built   the   scalable   infrastructure   we   have.   So   I'm   excited   
about   the   opportunity   there.   
  
On   your   second   question   around   eCommerce,   digital   platforms,   shopping,   social,   how   does   it   
all   fit   together?   You   know,   for   me,   I   see   it   as   two   things.   One   is   we   want   to   get   the   primitives   
right,   which   means   as   a   user,   being   able   to,   be   it   in   Search,   in   YouTube,   either   on   the   products  
or   as   you   --   you   know,   we   are   trying   to   connect   merchants   to   users,   right?   And   be   it   organically   
or   through   advertising.   And   so   we   are   investing   in   identity,   payments,   making   sure   it's   seamless   
for   users.   And   so   that's   a   big   part   of   our   focus.   
  
The   second   is   really   from   a   user   experience   standpoint,   both   in   Search   and   in   YouTube   and   
other   areas   like   Maps   and   Discover,   over   time.   We   want   to   make   sure   if   users   want   to   act   more   
beyond   discovery   and   they   want   to   do   more,   that   it's   seamless   to   do   so.   But   we're   going   to   be   
very   focused   on   making   sure   for   merchants   that,   you   know,   that   they   get   access   to   users,   and   
that's   the   value   proposition   we   deeply   care   about,   and   so   we'll   invest   with   that   view   in   mind.   
  
Colin   Sebastian,   Baird:    Okay.   Thank   you   very   much.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   our   last   question   comes   from   the   line   of   Stephen   Ju   from   Credit   
Suisse.   Your   line   is   now   open.   
  
Stephen   Ju,   Credit   Suisse:     Okay.   Thank   you.   So,   Sundar,   I   think   in   the   past   we've   talked   
about   the   intersection   of   hardware   and   software   for   Google.   And,   you   know,   you   touched   on   the   
Pixel   6   as   well   as   the   other   examples   in   your   prepared   remarks.   But   as   you   look   at   all   the   
different   directions   you're   going   with   Fitbit,   Nest,   and   all   the   other   devices,   how   has   your   
thinking   evolved   over   the   years?   And   what   do   you   envision   a   hardware   and   software,   you   know,   
integrated   Google   meaning   to   the   consumer   over   the   longer   term?   
  
And   I   guess,   Philipp,   if   you   look   at   some   of   the   emerging   and   developing   markets   today,   you   
know,   some   of   the   companies   there   around   the   world   have   had   to   play   multiple   roles   in   helping   
to   solve   for   transactional   friction   by   rolling   out   payments,   logistics   and   other   solutions   that   we   
probably   take   for   granted   here   in   the   States.   So   do   you   think   Google   should   or   could   play   a   
more   expansive   role   in   India   and   some   of   the   other   emerging   markets   to   help   accelerate   the   
growth   of   eCommerce   versus   the   role   that,   you   know,   you   play   in   the   U.S.   and   the   West.   
Thanks.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Overall,   hardware   and   computing,   obviously   we   --   
you   know,   we   have   been   doing   this   for   a   while   now.   You   know,   if   you   look   at   the   Google   Tensor   
bet,   these   are   multi-year   bets   which,   you   know,   which   finally   play   out.   And   I   couldn't   be   more   
excited   at   the   reception   for   Pixel   --   Pixel   6   and   Google   Tensor.   And   I   think,   you   know,   this   lays   a   
good   foundation   for   what   we   want   to   do   in   the   future.   
  
We   definitely   have   a   long-term   view   on   where   computing   is   headed   –   we   want   to   make   sure   –   
and   to   innovate   there   you   have   to   think   at   the   intersection   of   user   experience,   software   and   
14   
hardware.   I   think   we   have   a   unique   perspective   to   bring,   unique   point   of   view   with   our   AI-first   
approach   and   applying   that   to   bring   --   bring   new   features   and   new   experiences.     
  
So   we'll   be   doing   it   to   push   computing   forward.   We   want   to   guide   our   ecosystem.   When   we   do   
well   in   a   category,   the   whole   ecosystem   benefits   from   it.   And   finally,   we're   going   to   be   doing   this   
with   a   view   towards   building   a   sustainable   business.   And   we   see   this   as   an   important   area,   and   
we   are   investing   with   that   viewpoint.   And   I'm   really   excited,   you   know,   with   what   Google   Tensor   
and   the   Pixel   6   team   has   been   able   to   accomplish,   and   I   view   it   just   as   a   start.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    So   on   the   second   part   of   your   question,   look,   
every   commerce   experience   is   also   a   payment   experience,   and   a   friction-laden   checkout   can   
take   the   joy   out   of   a   purchase.   I   think   we   all   have   been   there.   So   think   about   Google   Pay   as   a   
checkout   facilitator.   We   want   to   make   it   even   easier   for   consumers   to   access   whatever   payment   
method   they   really   want:   credit   card,   PayPal,   Shop   Pay,   and   so   on   and   so   on.     
And   to   the   global   nature   of   your   question,   150   million   people   across   40   countries   are   now   using   
Google   Pay   to   manage   transactions   and   stay   on   top   of   their   finances,   and   millions   of   merchants   
are   using   it   to   provide   their   customers   with   a   simple   and   safe   way   to   check   out,   whether   it's   in   
store   or   online   or   the   via   their   app.   So   right   now   we   continue   to   be   very   focused   on   helping   both   
merchants   and   financial   institutions   create   more   intuitive   digital   experiences   and   connect   with   
their   customers.   In   the   U.S.,   we're   partnering   with   merchants   to   surface,   we   call   them   
card-linked   offers   and   coupons   within   Google   Pay.   And   in   August   we   announced   the   
partnership   with   Setu   –   a   fintech   company   in   India,   that   was   a   part   of   your   question,   to   help   
users   open   fixed   deposit   accounts   directly   from   Google   Pay.   So   we   think   there's   much   more   
that   we   can   do   for   both   consumers   and   our   partners,   so   stay   tuned   on   this   one.     
  
Stephen   Ju,   Credit   Suisse:    Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   that   concludes   our   question   and   answer   session.   I'd   like   to   turn   the   
conference   back   over   to   Jim   Friedland   for   any   closing   remarks.   
  
Jim   Friedland,   Director   Investor   Relations:    Thanks,   everyone,   for   joining   us   today.   We   look   
forward   to   speaking   with   you   again   on   our   fourth   quarter   2021   call.   Thank   you,   and   have   a   good   
evening.     
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   This   concludes   today's   conference   call.   Thank   you   for   participating.   You   
may   now   disconnect.
