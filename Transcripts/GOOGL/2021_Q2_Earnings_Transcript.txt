Jim   Friedland,   Director   Investor   Relations:    Thank   you.   Good   afternoon,   everyone,   and   
welcome   to   Alphabet’s   second-quarter   2021   earnings   conference   call.   With   us   today   are   
Sundar   Pichai,   Philipp   Schindler   and   Ruth   Porat.   Now   I’ll   quickly   cover   the   Safe   Harbor.   Some   
of   the   statements   that   we   make   today   regarding   our   business,   operations,   and   financial  
performance,   including   the   effect   of   the   COVID-19   pandemic   on   those   areas,   may   be   
considered   forward-looking,   and   such   statements   involve   a   number   of   risks   and   uncertainties   
that   could   cause   actual   results   to   differ   materially.   For   more   information,   please   refer   to   the   risk   
factors   discussed   in   our   most   recent   Form   10-K   filed   with   the   SEC.   During   this   call,   we   will   
present   both   GAAP   and   non-GAAP   financial   measures.   A   reconciliation   of   non-GAAP   to   GAAP   
measures   is   included   in   today's   earnings   press   release,   which   is   distributed   and   available   to   the   
public   through   our   Investor   Relations   website   located   at   abc.xyz/investor.   And   now   I’ll   turn   the   
call   over   to   Sundar.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thank   you,   Jim,   and   good   afternoon,   everyone.   
It’s   good   to   be   with   you.   Today,   I’ll   give   an   overview   of   the   quarter,   going   through   some   of   our   
product   momentum,   then   touching   on   Cloud   and   YouTube.   First,   I   want   to   acknowledge   that   the   
new   COVID-19   variants   have   been   challenging   for   so   many   communities   across   the   world.   As   
the   pandemic   evolves,   we   want   to   help   people   get   the   information   they   need   to   keep   
themselves   and   their   families   safe.   I   really   encourage   everyone   to   get   the   vaccine   when   it’s   
available   to   you.     
  
Turning   to   the   quarter,   we   saw   a   rising   tide   of   online   consumer   and   business   activity.   We’re   
proud   that   our   services   helped   so   many   businesses   and   partners.   In   fact,   we   set   a   number   of   
records   this   quarter.   This   quarter,   publisher   partners   earned   more   than   they   ever   have   from   our   
network.   We   also   paid   more   to   YouTube   creators   and   partners   than   in   any   quarter   in   our   history.   
And   on   top   of   that,   over   the   past   year,   we   have   sent   more   traffic   to   third   party   websites   than   any   
year   prior,   in   addition   to   generating   billions   of   direct   connections   -   like   phone   calls,   directions,   
ordering   food   and   making   reservations   –   that   drove   customers   and   revenue   to   businesses   
around   the   world   that   are   working   to   get   back   on   their   feet.   
  
A   few   years   ago,   we   placed   a   bet   on   AI,   believing   that   it   would   be   a   fundamental   technology   that   
would   underpin   and   dramatically   improve   all   our   products.   That   vision   was   on   full   display   at   our   
I/O   event   in   May,   where   we   announced   new   advancements   that   will   be   helpful   to   people   and   
businesses   everywhere.   
  
1   
As   one   example,   we   introduced   Multitask   Unified   Models   –   or   MUM.   MUM   is   a   big   advancement   
in   Search,   a   thousand   times   more   powerful   than   our   current   systems.   It   has   the   ability   to   learn   
and   transfer   knowledge   across   75   languages,   which   means   that   it   can   learn   from   sources   in   one   
language,   and   help   bring   that   information   to   you   in   another.   We   also   announced   a   new   AI   
system   called   LaMDA   that   achieves   a   new   level   of   natural   conversation   capabilities.   We   think   
LaMDA   will   help   make   information   and   computing   more   accessible,   and   we’re   excited   about   this   
early-stage   research.   And   last   week,   DeepMind   shared   its   new   AlphaFold   protein   structure   
database,   which   doubled   the   number   of   high-accuracy   human   protein   structures   available   to   
researchers.   In   the   coming   months   it   will   include   almost   every   sequenced   protein   known   to   
science.     
  
Turning   to   Android,   we   previewed   Android   12   at   Google   I/O.   The   latest   version   will   include   new   
ways   to   personalize   devices,   and   significantly   improved   speed   and   power   efficiency.   We’ve   built   
new   privacy   protections   directly   into   the   OS   –   such   as   the   new   Privacy   Dashboard   –   to   help   
people   keep   information   safe   and   private.   Android   12   will   of   course   be   central   to   Google’s   own   
devices.   I’m   very   excited   by   our   Fall   lineup,   which   will   showcase   Android   12,   and   some   of   the   
deep   technology   investments   that   are   helping   us   push   boundaries.     
  
Pixel   remains   at   the   heart   of   that   long-term   strategy,   and   I’m   proud   of   how   the   team   continues   to   
deliver   the   best   of   Google   through   our   family   of   helpful   devices,   including   Nest   and   Fitbit.   You   
can   see   all   of   these   devices   at   our   first   retail   store   in   New   York   City   and   I’m   looking   forward   to   
seeing   some   new   ones   there   soon.   We   are   also   seeing   developers   getting   tremendous   benefit   
from   Google   Play.   Through   the   end   of   Q2,   over   $120   billion   has   been   earned   cumulatively   by   
developers   around   the   world   from   Google   Play.   
  
Let   me   talk   a   bit   more   about   Cloud.   Q2   revenue   grew   54%   year-over-year.   Our   innovative   
products,   focused   Go-to-Market   strategy,   and   growing   ecosystem   are   driving   our   momentum.   
Organizations   across   industries   are   choosing   Google   Cloud   as   their   platform   for   digital   
transformation,   including   SAP   customers   like   PayPal,   Johnson   Controls,   and   Whirlpool,   who   
have   deployed   SAP   environments   on   Google   Cloud.   
  
This   quarter,   we   saw   three   distinct   trends.    First,   the   increase   in   cyber   and   ransomware   attacks   
is   a   wake-up   call   for   the   industry.   Over   two   decades,   Google   has   built   some   of   the   most   secure   
computing   systems   in   the   world,   and   we’re   proud   that   our   Google   Cloud   customers   can   benefit   
from   our   experience   here.   Customers   like   Major   League   Baseball   are   partnering   with   Google   
Cloud   to   further   enhance   their   security   program.   
  
We   pioneered   the   “zero   trust”   approach,   an   architecture   that   builds   in   multiple   layers   of   defense   
against   unauthorized   access.   This   approach,   and   other   security   solutions,   help   customers   
minimize   the   impact   of   cyber   attacks,   and   prevent   them   completely.   At   our   Cloud   Security   
Summit   last   week,   we   announced   new   solutions   across   our   portfolio   of   products.   BT   is    bringing   
our   new   Security   Operations   solution,   based   on   Chronicle,   to   the   managed   security   services   
market,    and   Adobe   and   the   state   of   Wisconsin   are   helping   protect   users   with   our   fraud   detection   
product.   
  
Second,   our   expertise   in   real-time   data   and   analytics   continues   to   differentiate   us   in   the   Data   
Cloud,   one   of   the   fastest   growing   segments   of   the   market.   BigQuery   is   not   only   a   data   
warehouse,   it’s   a   platform   for   customer   innovation.   And   it   is   helping   drive   our   strong   
2   
year-over-year   growth,   with   customers   like   HCA   Healthcare,   who   will   be   using   BigQuery   to   
analyze   data   to   improve   clinical   care.   Additionally,   our   deep   exp ertise    in   AI   and   machine   
learning   remains   a   key   differentiator,   winning   customers   like   Groupe   Casino   and   leading   to   
partnerships   with   industrial   automation   leaders   like   Siemens.   
  
Our   focus   on   delivering   industry   specific   solutions,   coupled   with   our   secure,   open   cloud   
infrastructure   enable   us   to   support   leading   telecommunications   companies   such   as   Reliance   
Jio,   Telecom   Italia   TIM,   and   Ericsson,   to   work   together   on   applications   and   new   solutions   for   5G   
networks   and   Mobile   Edge   Computing.   These   join   existing   customers   Vodafone,   Telus   and   
many   others.   
  
Third,   Google   Workspace   continues   to   show   strong   growth,   particularly   in   the   enterprise   space,   
because   we   have   designed   the   product   to   meet   the   challenges   of   hybrid   work.   This   includes   the   
announcements   we   made   at   I/O   about   Smart   Canvas,   as   well   as   expanding   our   advanced   
security   and   compliance   capabilities   and   solutions   for   front   line   workers.   These   innovations   are   
landing   wins   with   companies   like   Carvana,   the   online   auto   retailer,   and   software   company,   Red   
Hat.     
  
Turning   next   to   YouTube.   YouTube   Shorts   continues   to   gain   momentum.   We've   been   rolling   it   
out   everywhere   YouTube   is   available,   in   more   than   100   countries   worldwide.   I’m   proud   to   
announce   that   YouTube   Shorts   has   just   surpassed   15   billion   daily   views.   I’m   also   pleased   with   
the   progress   we’re   making   with   YouTube’s   subscription   products   across   Music,   Premium   and   
YouTube   TV,   each   delivering   a   fantastic   experience   and   content   for   viewers.   
  
And   finally,   Waymo   continues   to   build   and   commercialize   the   Waymo   Driver   and   grow   the   team.   
People   love   the   fully   autonomous   ride   hailing   service   in   Phoenix.   Since   first   launching   its   
services   to   the   public   in   October   2020,   Waymo   has   safely   served   tens   of   thousands   of   rides   
without   a   human   driver   in   the   vehicle,   and   we   look   forward   to   many   more .   
  
Before   I   close,   let   me   call   out   our   continued   work   on   sustainability,   which   has   been   a   core   value   
for   us   since   our   founding.   As   you’ll   recall,   we   were   the   first   to   announce   an   ambitious   goal   that   
will   be   transformative   for   the   industry:   we   aim   to   operate   on   24/7   carbon-free   energy   by   2030.   In  
Q2   we   announced   that   five   of   our   data   centers   are   already   operating   at   or   near   90%   carbon-free   
energy.   To   help   us   reach   our   target   everywhere,   we   implemented   a   system   to   shift   flexible   
computing   tasks   to   different   times   and   places   with   greater   availability   of   carbon-free   energy,   and   
we’re   working   to   enable   geothermal   power   in   more   places,   starting   in   Nevada   next   year.   
  
I   want   to   thank   all   our   employees   around   the   world   for   their   contributions   to   a   great   quarter.   I   
know   it’s   been   a   challenging   18   months.   Through   it   all,   taking   care   of   everyone   in   our   workforce   
has   remained   a   top   priority.   Now,   we’re   reimagining   the   future   of   work,   with   flexibility   as   a   
guiding   principle.   I   was   excited   to   see   so   many   people   in   person   as   we   started   a   voluntary   
return   to   our   California   offices   recently.   As   we   make   our   way   back,   we’re   giving   employees   more   
flexibility   in   how   and   where   they   work,   and   we’ll   continue   to   invest   in   our   sites   in   the   US   and   
elsewhere.   Over   to   Philipp.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:     Thanks,   Sundar,   and   hello   everyone,   it’s   great   to   
be   with   you   today.   We’re   pleased   with   the   growth   in   Google   Services   revenues   in   the   second   
quarter.   Year-on-year   performance   reflects   elevated   consumer   online   activity,   broad-based   
3   
strength   in   advertiser   spend,   and   the   lapping   of   the   first-ever   revenue   decline   in   our   Ads   
business   last   year   due   to   COVID.   In   the   second   quarter,   retail   again   was   by   far   the   largest   
contributor   to   the   year-on-year   growth   of   our   Ads   business.   Travel,   financial   services,   and   
media   and   entertainment   were   also   strong   contributors.   Let’s   now   take   a   few   minutes   to   talk   
about   the   trends   we’ve   seen   across   our   business.   
  
Over   the   last   18   months,   we’ve   been   deeply   focused   on   helping   businesses,   big   and   small,   
navigate   profound   change.   First   as   a   lifeline   during   the   pandemic    –    and   now   as   a   partner   to   
re-accelerate   growth   as   the   world   begins   to   reopen.   The   road   to   global   recovery   is   likely   to   be   
uneven   and   unpredictable.   That’s   why   the   real-time   insights   we   put   in   the   hands   of   businesses  
going   into   the   pandemic   will   be   just   as   important   coming   out   of   it.   New   tools,   like   Travel   Insights   
–    which   launched   in   the   US   this   month   after   rolling   out   to   select   countries   in   APAC   and   EMEA   in   
December    –    are   helping   our   partners   get   a   clearer   picture   of   where   demand   is   coming   from.     
  
Wyndham   Hotels   &   Resorts,   for   example,   is   leaning   into   insights   and   automation   across   Search,   
Display   and   YouTube   to   meet   travelers,   wherever   and   whenever,   they   need   a   hotel.   They   drove   
nearly   two   times   more   direct   bookings   from   media   deployed   on   Google   in   the   first   half   of   2021   
vs.   the   year   prior.   Or   take   Amtrak.   COVID   hit,   ridership   plummeted,   budgets   were   cut.   
Uncertainty   ensued   on   how   to   efficiently   reach   essential   travelers.   So   we   stepped   in   with   
insights   and   automation.   Bookings   for   their   last   quarter,   which   was   Q2,   increased   3X   
year-over-year   with   Cost   Per   Acquisition   down   52%.  
  
These   examples   also   underscore   the   value   of   AI   and   automation   in   a   world   that’s   changing   fast.   
We   know   today   that   more   than   80%   of   our   advertisers   use   automated   bidding.   Using   ML,   our   
ads   products   are   more   efficiently   connecting   businesses   with   their   customers    –    taking   the   
guesswork   out   of   getting   the   right   message,   at   the   right   time,   to   the   right   customers    –    all   in   a   
privacy-first   way.   And   Performance   Max,   our   newest   AI-powered   campaign,   is   now   in   beta.   It   
lets   brands   buy   ads   from   a   single   campaign   across   all   Google   properties    –    helping   drive   more   
online   sales,   more   leads   and/or   more   Store   Visits.   Early   results   for   participating   advertisers   are   
great.   
  
Moving   onto   Retail,   where   momentum   remains   strong.   We’re   continuing   to   build   an   open   
ecosystem   that   benefits   both   users   and   merchants.   Last   year   we   removed   financial   barriers   with   
free   product   listings   and   zero   commission   fees.   This   year   we’re   removing   integration   barriers.   
With   Shopify,   WooCommerce,   GoDaddy   and   Square,   merchants   can   now   onboard   and   show   
their   products   across   Google   for   free.   And   our   Shopping   Graph   is   using   AI   to   connect   these   
products   to   the   people   who   want   them,   with   over   24   billion   listings   from   millions   of   merchants   
across   the   web.   
  
Let’s   talk   omnichannel.   Last   quarter   I   said   it   was   here   to   stay    –    and   it   is.   Retailers   continue   to   
build   their   digital   presence   to   drive   both   online   and   offline   sales    –    and   we’re   helping   them   do   it.   
Take   Bed   Bath   &   Beyond   who   quickly   pivoted   to   curbside   pickup,   pick-up-in-store,   and   
same-day   delivery   when   people   were   stuck   at   home.   They’ve   continued   these   offerings   across   
Google   with   impressive   success.   Omni   and   digital   shoppers   now   make   up   50%   of   customers,   
and   in   Q1,   a   third   of   total   digital   sales   were   fulfilled   by   stores.   Plus   they’ve   tapped   YouTube   to   
build   awareness   for   their   new   customer-inspired   Owned-brands.   We’ll   continue   to   invest   in   new   
ways   to   help   retailers   through   what   is   likely   to   be   a   long   and   uncertain   recovery   around   the   
world.

Let’s   move   to   YouTube,   which   had   a   great   quarter   with   strong   growth   in   both   brand   and   direct   
response.   We’re   seeing   three   key   trends.   First,   brand.   YouTube   is   helping   advertisers   reach   
audiences   they   can’t   find   anywhere   else.   According   to   Nielsen’s   Total   Ad   Ratings   Reach   
reporting,   from   Q4   ‘18   to   Q4   ‘20,   on   average,   70%   of   YouTube’s   reach   was   delivered   to   an   
audience   not   reached   by   the   advertiser’s   TV   media.   In   other   words,   YouTube’s   reach   is   
becoming   increasingly   incremental   to   TV,   and   this   audience   dynamic   is   a   huge   win   for   brands.     
In   fact,   Nielsen   found   that   US   advertisers   who   shifted   just   20%   of   spend   from   TV   to   YouTube   
generated   a   25%   increase   to   their   total   campaign   reach   within   their   target   audience,   while   
lowering   their   cost   per   reach   point   by   almost   20%.   These   combined   effects   of   improved   reach   
and   efficiency   are   helping   advertisers   get   the   most   out   of   their   brand   investments.   
Second,   direct   response.   Advertisers   are   turning   to   the   platform   to   generate   demand   and   drive   
transactions.   Like   Malaysian   edtech   platform   Mindvalley,   which   focuses   on   personal   growth   and   
learning,   increased   their   investment   in   TrueView   for   Action,   and   now   Video   Action,   as   people   
turned   to   YouTube   in   record   numbers   to   learn.   In   Q2,   this   generated   600,000+   leads   –   with   20%   
coming   from   the   U.S.   
  
Third,   YouTube   is   uniquely   positioned   to   drive   both   massive   reach   and   action.   We’re   seeing   
more   advertisers   adopt   a   full   funnel   approach   to   scale   their   businesses   with   increased   
efficiency.   Compara,   a   financial   services   market   leader   in   Chile,   combined   a   reach   and   direct   
response   campaign   to   capitalize   on   leads.   Over   10   weeks,   they   reached   5   million   users   with   
incremental   conversions   up   70%.   This   trend   is   widely   embraced   by   our   largest   advertisers   
where   businesses   are   breaking   down   silos   between   online   and   offline.     
  
Since   our   founding,   we’ve   always   believed   that   the   future   of   Google   and   the   future   of   our   
partners   are   intrinsically   linked.   From   individual   YouTube   creators   and   major   music   labels,   to   
global   and   local   online   publishers,   to   Play   developers   big   and   small   –   our   business   is   built   on   
revenue   share   models   that   succeed   only   when   our   partners   succeed.     
  
One   excellent   example   of   how   we're   helping   our   partners   innovate   is   our   work   with   the   telecom   
industry.   Sundar   talked   about   efforts   in   Cloud   to   help   them   build   more   efficient   networks   and   
transition   to   5G.   We’re   also   working   across   Google   to   help   carriers   –   including   AT&T,    Telstra,   
T-Mobile,   and    Verizon    –   launch   new   devices   and   services,   add   new   subscribers,   rethink   
customer   engagement   via   business   messaging   partnerships,   and   support   enterprise   growth.     
  
I   want   to   close   with   two   huge   “thank   you’s.”   First   to   our   customers   and   partners   for   their   
collaboration.   Second   to   our   product,   partnership,   sales   and   many   support   teams   for   their   
extraordinary   work   this   quarter   and   dedication   to   our   customers’   and   partners’   success.   Now,   
over   to   Ruth.    
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thank   you,   Philipp.   Our   strong   revenue   performance   
in   the   second   quarter   reflects   lapping   the   impact   of   COVID   on   our   business,   elevated   consumer   
online   activity,   broad-based   strength   in   advertiser   spend,   as   well   as   the   benefit   of   excellent   
ongoing   execution   by   our   teams.   My   comments   will   be   on   year-over-year   comparisons   for   the   
second   quarter,   unless   I   state   otherwise.   We   will   start   with   results   at   the   Alphabet   level,   
followed   by   segment   results,   and   conclude   with   our   outlook.

For   the   second   quarter,   our   Consolidated   Revenues   were   $61.9   billion,   up   62%,   or   up   57%   in   
constant   currency.   Our   total   cost   of   revenues   was   $26.2   billion,   up   41%,   primarily   driven   by   
growth   in   TAC,   which   was   $10.9   billion,   up   63%,   followed   by   growth   in   Other   Cost   of   Revenues,   
which   was   $15.3   billion,   up   29%,   the   largest   driver   of   which   was   content   acquisition   costs.     
    
Operating   expenses   were   $16.3   billion,   up   22%.   In   terms   of   the   three   component   parts   of   opex,   
first,   the   increase   in   R&D   expenses   was   driven   primarily   by   headcount   growth.   Second,   the   
growth   in   Sales   &   Marketing   expenses   was   due   primarily   to   the   ramp-up   of   spending   on   ads   and   
promo,   in   contrast   to   the   pullback   in   the   second   quarter   last   year.   Finally,   the   increase   in   G&A   
reflects   the   impact   of   charges   relating   to   legal   matters.   Headcount   was   up   4,061   from   the   first   
quarter.   Operating   income   was   $19.4   billion,   up   203%   and   our   operating   margin   in   the   quarter   
was   31%.   Other   Income   and   Expense   was   $2.6   billion,   which   primarily   reflects   unrealized   gains   
in   the   value   of   investments   in   equity   securities.   Net   income   was   $18.5   billion.     
  
Let   me   now   turn   to   our   segment   financial   results.   Starting   with   our   Google   Services   segment,   
Total   Google   Services   Revenues   were   $57.1   billion,   up   63%.   Google   search   and   other   
advertising   revenues   of   $35.8   billion   in   the   quarter,   were   up   68%,   with   broad-based   strength   
across   our   business,   led   again   by   strong   growth   in   retail.   YouTube   advertising   revenues   of   $7.0   
billion,   were   up   84%,   driven   by   brand,   followed   by   direct   response.   Network   advertising   
revenues   of   $7.6   billion,   were   up   60%,   driven   by   Ad   Manager   and   AdMob.     
  
Other   Revenues   were   $6.6   billion,   up   29%,   primarily   driven   by   growth   in   YouTube   
non-advertising   revenues,   followed   by   Hardware,   which   benefited   from   the   addition   of    Fitbit   
revenues,   and   finally   Google   Play,   which   lapped   the   increased   level   of   user   engagement   that   
started   in   Q1   last   year   due   to   the   pandemic.    Google   Services   Operating   income   was   $22.3   
billion,   up   134%,   and   the   operating   margin   was   39%.     
  
Turning   to   the   Google   Cloud   segment,   revenues   were   $4.6   billion   for   the   second   quarter,   up   
54%.   GCP’s   revenue   growth   was   again   above   Cloud   overall,   reflecting   significant   growth   in   both   
infrastructure   and   platform   services.   Once   again,   strong   growth   in   Google   Workspace   revenues   
was   driven   by   robust   growth   in   both   seats   and   average   revenue   per   seat.   Google   Cloud   had   an   
Operating   Loss   of   $591   million.   As   to   our   Other   Bets,   in   the   first    [sic]    [second]   quarter,   revenues   
were   $192   million.   The   operating   loss   was   $1.4   billion.     
  
Let   me   close   with   some   comments   on   our   outlook.   In   the   second   quarter,   revenues   benefited   
from   an   FX   tailwind   of   more   than   4%   at   the   consolidated   level.   Based   on   FX   spot   rates   against   
the   dollar   relative   to   the   third   quarter   of   last   year,   we   expect   a   more   muted   tailwind   to   revenues   
in   the   third   quarter.   
  
In   terms   of   outlook   by   segment,   for   Google   Services,   the   benefit   to   revenue   growth   in   Q2   from   
lapping   the   effect   of   COVID   last   year   will   diminish   through   the   balance   of   the   year   as   we   begin   
to   lap   stronger   performance   in   the   second   half   of   2020.   In   the   second   quarter,   we   continued   to   
benefit   from   elevated   consumer   online   activity   and   broad-based   strength   in   advertiser   spend.   
We   believe   it   is   still   too   early   to   forecast   the   longer-term   trends   as   markets   reopen,   especially   
given   the   recent   increase   in   COVID   cases   globally.    
  
6   
Within   Other   Revenues,   Play   revenue   growth   for   the   balance   of   the   year   will   face   headwinds   
due   to   the   impact   of   lapping   elevated   engagement   in   the   pandemic   as   well   as   the   change   in   fee   
structure   which   was   implemented   as   of   July   1.   We   continue   to   invest   across   Google   Services   to   
support   the   extraordinary   opportunities   we   see.   A   couple   of   reminders,   consistent   with   prior   
years.   We   expect   that   headcount   additions   will   be   seasonally   higher   in   Q3,   as   we   bring   on   new   
graduates.   In   addition,   we   expect   Sales   and   Marketing   expenses   to   be   more   heavily   weighted   to   
the   back   half   of   the   year   in   part   to   support   product   launches   and   the   holiday   season .   
  
As   for   Google   Cloud,   we    remain   focused   on   revenue   growth,   and   are   pleased   with   the   trends   
we   are   seeing.   Across   Cloud,   we   will   continue   to   invest   aggressively   given   the   opportunity   we   
see.     
  
Turning   to   CapEx,   the   results   in   the   second   quarter   primarily   reflect   ongoing   investment   in   our   
technical   infrastructure,   most   notably   in   servers,   to   support   ongoing   growth   across   Google.   We   
also   began   to   increase   the   pace   of   investment   in   ground-up   construction   and   fit-outs   of   office   
facilities,   which   were   slowed   due   to   COVID   and   are   focused   now   on   advancing   these   projects.   
  
Turning   to   cash   and   capital   allocation,   we   continue   [ sic ]   [continued]   to   generate   strong   Free   
Cash   Flow   of   $16.4   billion   in   the   quarter   and   $58.5   billion   for   the   trailing   twelve   months.   We   
ended   the   second   quarter   with   $136   billion   in   cash   and   marketable   securities.   As   we   indicated   in   
our   press   release   today,   our   Board   has   approved   an   amendment   to   the   existing   $50   billion   stock   
repurchase   program   permitting   us   to   repurchase   both   Class   A   and   Class   C   shares,   in   a   manner   
that’s   in   the   best   interest   of   the   company   and   its   stockholders.   Thank   you.   And   now   Sundar,   
Philipp   and   I   will   take   your   questions.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   As   a   reminder,   to   ask   a   question,   you'll   need   to   press   star   one   on   your   
telephone.   To   withdraw   your   question,   press   the   pound   key.   To   prevent   any   background   noise,   
we   ask   that   you   please   mute   your   line   once   your   question   has   been   stated.   And   our   first   
question   comes   from   Brian   Nowak,   with   Morgan   Stanley.   Your   line   is   open.   
  
Brian   Nowak,   Morgan   Stanley:    Thanks   for   taking   my   question.   I   have   two.   One   for   Sundar.   
One   for   Philipp.   Sundar,   the   first   one   is,   you've   had   so   much   innovation   over   the   years   using   AI   
to   improve   Search   and   improve   the   overall   business.   Can   you   just   give   us   some   examples   of   
where   you   still   see   low-hanging   fruit   or   areas   for   further   improvement   in   the   company's   overall   
products,   using   AI,   et cetera,   over   the   next   couple   years?   And   then,   Philipp,   your   comments   on   
omnichannel   were   pretty   loud   and   clear.   Give   us   some   examples   of   where   you're   most   focused   
to   continue   to   enable   more   retailers   to   move   in   the   omnichannel   and   sort   of   drive   that   side   of   
the   business.   Thanks.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Brian,   thanks.   A   couple   –   we   see   so   much   
headroom,   given   our   bet   on   AI.   Going   to   our   most   important   product   of   all,   Search,   when   you   
see   the   launch   of   BERT,   which   was   a   significant   improvement,   and   we   are   following   that   up   with   
MUM,   which   is   another   extraordinary   advance.   So   the   rate   information   is   growing   –   pretty   
rapidly,   and   so   constantly   developing   better   models   to   improve   our   search   quality   ranking,   
et cetera,   is   one   of   the   most   important   ways   we   invest.   Beyond   that,   I   would   say   all   the   work   we   
are   doing   into   making   sure   computers   can   understand   in   a   multimodal   way,   be   it   images,   audio,   
text,   video,   and   then   bringing   it   up   across   our   products   I   think   is   an   important   way   we'll   
approach   it.   Philipp?   
7   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Yes.   And   to   my   part   of   the   question,   look,   we   want   
to   make   sure   that   when   people   come   to   Google,   they   are   able   to   basically   find   the   best   product   
and   prices   available   from,   frankly,   the   widest   possible   range   of   merchants.   And   we're   making   
strong   progress   under   Bill's   leadership.   And   as   I   said   earlier,   2020   was   about   removing   financial   
barriers.   We   made   listings   free.   We   removed   commission   fees.   And   it's   worth   pointing   out   the   
upside   of   combining   free   listings   with   Shopping   Ads,   actually.   Merchants   that   used   both   in   Q1   
saw   a   50%   lift   in   clicks   once   they   started.   I   think   that's   pretty   impressive.   2021,   as   I   said,   has   
been   about   removing   integration   barriers.   We   have   the   partnerships   with   Shopify,   Square,   
BigCommerce,   GoDaddy,   WooCommerce   and   so   on.   And   they're   making   it   easier   for   
businesses   to   get   started   with   us,   whether   it's   across   Search   and   Shopping   and   Image   Search   
and   YouTube.     
  
And   then   once   merchants   are   onboarded,   I   mean,   there's   so   much   more   value   we   can   offer   
them.   We   launched   a   new   measurement   tool   to   help   retailers   better   understand   performance   
and   pricing.   You   asked   specifically   a   question   about   focus   areas.   And   then   we're   making   the   
product   and   user   experience   better,   not   only   with   our   UI/UX   research/feedback,   with   our   tech   
and   AI   capabilities.   And   a   maybe   cool   example   is   how   we're   using   AR   to   bring   in-store   
experiences   online,   like   with   auto   dealerships,   and   letting   users   really   try   before   they   buy.   And   
we   do   this   in   cosmetics   and   in   apparel   categories.   And   we   have   the   Shopping   Graph,   which   I   
mentioned   earlier.   And   we   think   it   will   open   up   completely   new   product   experiences   across   
Google.   Shopping   with   Lens   is   one   example.   You   can   shop   your   screenshots   or   use   your   phone   
camera   to   find   the   dress   or   pair   of   sneakers   that   caught   your   eye   or   whatever.   And   we're   
working   hard   to   build   an   open   retail   ecosystem.   And   that   really   levels   the   playing   field   for   all   
merchants.   And   we   think   there's   a   lot   of   opportunity   ahead.   And   I   think   those   are   our   biggest   
areas   of   focus.   
  
Brian   Nowak,   Morgan   Stanley:    Great.   Thank   you,   both.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Doug   Anmuth,   with   JP   Morgan.   Your   line   
is   open.   
  
Doug   Anmuth,   JP   Morgan:    Great.   Thanks   for   taking   the   question.   I   have   two.   First,   just   I   think   
a   key   initiative   over   the   last   couple   years   has   been   to   bring   the   full   breadth   of   Google   services   
to   customers.   So   I   was   hoping   you   could   talk   more   just   about   when   you   think   about   the   Search   
and   overall   ads   recovery   and   then   also   growth   in   Google   Cloud,   how   those   efforts   are   going,   as   
you   work   across   businesses   with   corporate   customers   and   what   their   reception   has   been.   And   
then,   Ruth,   just   on   cost   –   kind   of   in   the   back   half   and   going   forward,   as   you   think   about   bringing   
some   of   these   costs   back,   just   curious   if   you   can   comment   more   around   some   of   the   puts   and   
takes   as   you   think   about   the   overall   cost   structure   pre-COVID   versus   post-COVID.   Thanks.     
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Thanks,   Doug.   I   would   say,   overall,   as   you   
realize,   it's   a   broad   digital   shift.   Customers   are   looking   for   digital   transformation.   And   depending   
on   the   sector   they   are   in,   they   look   to   Alphabet   as   a   digital   partner.   And   we   try   to   bring   the   
broadest   solution   set   that's   possible   across   our   capabilities.   And   that's   been   working   well.     
  
You   mentioned   Cloud.   Most   of   our   Cloud   customers   are   either   in   conversations   with   us   –   it   
could   be   because   they're   concerned   about   security   on   their   supply   chain   or   they   are   trying   to

understand   the   shift   to   digital   and,   invest   more   in   data   analytics,   or   the   shift   to   a   hybrid   
workforce   is   what's   probably   getting   them   to   think   about   Workspace   and   so   on.   And   if   they   are   
retailers,   we   can   bring   in   our   expertise   across   Ads,   the   work   we   are   doing   on   commerce   to   be   –   
with   the   partnerships   we   have,   and   so   we   can   bring   those   additional   expertise   to   bear.     
  
And   so   that's   a   trend   we   are   seeing   across   –   Philipp   gave   examples   of   our   telco   partnerships.   
And   so   across   our   priority   verticals,   we   are   able   to   engage   in   a   broad   way.   And   maybe   the   
recent   Google-wide   partnership   with   Univision   was   another   example   of   a   multi-year,   
multi-product   partnership   with   companies.   
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    And   with   respect   to   the   second   question,   how   we   
think   about   investments   in   the   back   half,   really,   the   driving   focus   is   how   do   we   support   
near-term,   long-term   quality   growth.   And   I   think   it's   important   to   note   that   some   of   our   costs   are   
less   variable   in   the   short   term,   such   as   depreciation   and   the   operations   cost   of   our   data   
centers.   So   when   you   look   at   Q2   performance,   in   part,   the   meaningful   year-on-year   
improvement   in   the   operating   margin   in   the   second   quarter   clearly   reflects   the   strong   revenue   
growth   but   also   the   fact   that   some   of   these   costs   are   less   variable   in   the   short   term.     
  
However,   to   support   long-term   growth,   and   very   much   to   your   question,   it's   true   across   both  
Google   Services   and   Google   Cloud   we   will   continue   to   increase   the   pace   of   investment.   And   
that's   true   in   headcount,   it's   true   with   compute,   sales   and   marketing,   really   across   the   board.   
And   you   also   heard   that   in   some   of   my   comments   about   CapEx.   We're   continuing   to   pick   up   the   
pace   of   investment   in   office   facilities.   Both   fit-outs   and   ground-up   construction   had   been   slowed   
as   a   result   of   COVID,   and   we're   pleased   that   the   pace   has   picked   up.   And   that   really   relates   to   
our   comments   about   continuing   to   build   out   across   the   U.S.,   around   the   globe,   in   line   with   
continuing   to   invest   in   headcount   growth.     
  
I'd   make   one   other   point,   which   is –   I   think   you're   aware   of   this –   but   in   this   quarter,   the   results   
also   reflect   the   benefit   from   the   change   in   useful   lives   that   we   talked   about   earlier   in   the   year   
that   reduced   depreciation   expense.   It's   a   benefit   of   about   $721   million   in   the   quarter.   And   the   
benefit   from   this   change   will   be   lower   in   the   second   half   as   you're   looking   ahead.   
  
Doug   Anmuth,   JP   Morgan:    Great.   Thank   you,   Sundar   and   Ruth.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Justin   Post,   with   Bank   of   America.   Your   
line   is   open.   
  
Justin   Post,   Bank   of   America   Merrill   Lynch:    Great.   Thanks   for   taking   my   questions,   a   
couple.   When   you   look   at   Search   in   the   quarter,   it   really   accelerated   beyond   the   comp.   And   if   
you   look   at   it   quarter-over-quarter,   it   was   really   good.   So   wondering   if   there's   any   products   or   
verticals   that   really   surprised   you   or   things   to   call   out.   And   how   do   you   think   about   the   
sustainability   here,   specifically   in   Search   and   the   product   pipeline   from   here?   And   then,   
secondly,   on   Cloud,   really   saw   a   nice   margin   improvement   there.   How   do   you   feel   about   where   
you   are   on   the   infrastructure   side   and   ability   to   really   continue   to   show   kind   of   that   improvement   
in   margins   over   time?   Thank   you.     
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    You   know,   two   questions.   Maybe   I'll   take   the   
second   first.   On   the   Cloud   side,   first   of   all,   we   do –   in   the   investments   in   our   infrastructure,   first   
9   
of   all,   we   are   doing   it   across   the   set   of   Cloud   services   we   are   building   for   Google.   And   it's   the   
same   that   we   bring   to   Cloud.   And   so   there's   tremendous   synergies   we   have   there.   And   maybe   
to   give   you   an   example   of   it,   I   earlier   mentioned   data   analytics   and   processing.   It's   the   same   
infrastructure,   be   it   BigQuery,   et cetera,   which   we   have   invested   in   and   built   over   time.   And   
people   are   looking   to   use   data   analytics   alongside   with   machine   learning   and   AI.   They   want   to   
do   this   across   structured   and   unstructured   data,   do   it   across   any   platform.   And   so   that's   the   
kind   of   capability   we   are   able   to   bring.   And   overall,   I'll   let   Ruth   comment   on   maybe   the   margin   
side   of   this   a   bit   more.   Ruth?   
  
Ruth   Porat,   CFO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Yes.   I   would   just   build   on   Sundar's   comment.   There's   
really   no   change   in   our   approach   to   building   the   Cloud   business.   We   do   intend   to   continue   to   
invest   meaningfully.   We   are   very   pleased   with   the   business,   as   we   both   said.   As   an   example,   
we're   continuing   to   build   out   the   global   footprint,   continuing   to   invest   in   our   compute   capacity   
globally.   As   an   example,   we   most   recently   announced   a   second   Cloud   region   in   India.   This   is   
our   26th   Cloud   data   center   region   globally.   And   so   continuing   to   invest   across   the   board,   given   
the   opportunity   that   we   see.   And   as   I   said   last   quarter,   I   would   not   extrapolate   from   quarter   to   
quarter,   given   we   still   are   in   the   early   stages   of   building   the   business   and   we   do   intend   to   
continue   to   invest   aggressively,   including   expanding   our   go-to-market   organization,   our   channel   
expansion,   our   product   offerings   and   our   compute   capacity.   Excited   about   what   we're   seeing   
the   team   executing   upon   here.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    On   Search,   to   answer   the   first   part   of   your.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Yes,   can   you   hear   me?     
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Yes.     
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Yes,   and   to   the   first   part   of   the   question,   similar   to   
what   I   said   in   my   remarks   at   the   beginning,   retail   was,   again,   by   far,   the   largest   contributor   to   
the   year-on-year   growth   of   our   Ads   business.   Travel,   financial   services,   media   and   
entertainment   were   also   very,   very   strong   contributors.   
  
Justin   Post,   Bank   of   America   Merrill   Lynch:    Thank   you.     
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Colin   Sebastian,   with   Baird.   Your   line   is   
open.   
  
Colin   Sebastian,   Baird:    Great.   Thanks   for   taking   my   questions.   First,   Sundar,   as   a   follow-up   
on   Cloud,   you   talked   about   the   tailwinds   from   advanced   AI   and   data   analytics   in   terms   of   
growth.   Is   it   fair   to   say   as   well,   based   on   your   initial   comments,   that   security   also   represents   a   
competitive   differentiation   that's   contributing   incrementally   to   business   development?   And   then   
for   Philipp,   on   the   momentum   in   YouTube   and   capturing   the   shift   in   viewership   and   advertising   
away   from   linear   TV,   how   do   the   different   Google   services   fit   together   in   that?   Not   just   core   
YouTube,   but   Android   TV,   Google   TV,   YouTube   TV.   Is   this   something   that's   been   increasingly   
connected   or   linked   in   the   back-end   and   as   well   as   in   the   front-end   for   consumers?   Thanks.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    On   security   and   Cloud,   we   have –   definitely   see   it   
as   a   strong   differentiation.   Obviously,   Google,   for   a   long   time,   we   are   cloud   native.   We've   
10   
pioneered   approaches   like   "zero   trust",   built   the   architecture   out   from   a   security-first   
perspective.   And   so   particularly   over   the   course   of   the   last   couple   of   years,   as   companies   have   
really –   with   the   recent   attacks,   they've   really   started   thinking   deeply   about   the   vulnerabilities.   
Supply   chain   security   has   been   a   major   source   of   concern   just   particularly   over   the   past   few   
quarters.   Cyber   threats   increasingly   is   in   the   mind   of   not   just   CIOs,   but   CEOs   across   our   
partners.   And   so   it's   definitely   an   area   where   we   are   seeing   a   lot   of   conversations,   a   lot   of  
interest.   It's   our   strongest   product   portfolio,   and   we   are   continuing   to   enhance   our   solutions,   be   
it   integrating   Chronicle,   BeyondCorp   and   all   the   product   components   we   have   there.   So   a   
definite   source   of   strength,   and   you   will   continue   to   see   us   invest   here.   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    And   on   the   second   part   of   your   question,   look,   
momentum   is   really   strong   across   both   our   brand   and   direct   response   business   on   YouTube.   
Maybe   let   me   start   on   the   brand   side.   The   global   shift   to   online   video   and   streaming   continues,   
with   over,   like,   2   billion   monthly   active   users   now,   a   billion-plus   hours   of   video   watched   every   
day.   I   think   we're   at   the   forefront   of   this   shift.   And   advertisers   have   increasingly   needed   to   look   
beyond   linear   TV   alternatives   to   achieve   their   reach   and   awareness   goals.   And   as   I   said   earlier,   
Nielsen   Total   Ad   Ratings   Reach   reporting   found,   on   average,   70%   of   YouTube's   reach   was   
delivered   to   an   audience   not   reached   by   the   advertisers'   TV   media.   So   not   only   are   we   driving   
improved   reach,   but   we're   also   helping   brands   do   it   more   efficiently.   And   as   a   result   of   this,   you   
see   many   advertisers   reevaluating   their   media   mix   and   increasing   their   investments   in   our   
platform   –   in   our   platforms.     
  
And   as   far   as   the   direct   response   part   goes,   we're   helping   advertisers   convert   intent   into   action.   
We   try   to   drive   performance   at   an   incredible   scale.   Take   an   example   like   with   video   action   
campaigns,   which   is   our   next-generation   TrueView   for   Action   format,   advertisers   were   getting   
access   to   even   more   inventory   across   YouTube   and   our   partners,   all   in   a   single   automated   
campaign.   And   as   I   said   before,   we're   working   really   hard   to   make   YouTube   not   only   more   
actionable   but   also   more   shoppable.   So   YouTube   is   proving   to   be   meaningful   for   not   just   
brand-building   and   reaching   a   massive   audience   but   also   for   converting   viewers   into   buyers.   
And   what's   nice   is   that   we're   seeing   more   advertisers   leveraging   brand   to   create   demand   and   
direct   response   to   convert   it.   So   they're   basically   using   the   full   funnel   very,   very   smartly.     
  
And   then   to   the   second   part   of   your   second   question,   YouTube   TV   ads,   for   example,   this   part,   
we're   really   trying   to   bring   the   –   well,   Connected   TV   is   –   let   me   phrase   it   from   the   Connected   
TV   part.   I   think   that's   easier.   It   is   really   the   fastest-growing   consumer   surface   that   we   have,   and   
that   growth   started   before   the   pandemic   and   has,   frankly,   solidified   since.   And   in   the   U.S.,   we   
have   over   120   million   people   watch   YouTube   on   TVs   every   month.   And   that's   up   from,   like,   100   
million   last   year.   We're   number   one   in   reach   and   watch   time   among   ad-supported   streaming  
services.   So   we're   very,   very   happy   with   the   development   that   we're   seeing   here.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Brent   Thill   with   Jefferies.   Your   line   is   
open.   
  
Brent   Thill,   Jefferies:    Thanks.   Just   to   follow-up   on   YouTube.   Can   you   maybe   talk   to   the   
ecommerce   opportunity   that   you're   seeing   evolve?   Where   are   you   at   now   and   eventually   where   
you   would   like   to   be?   Thank   you.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    On   YouTube,   look,   I   mean,   if   you   look   at   the   
11   
engagement   across   the   platform,   we   definitely   see   a   lot   of   headroom   for   ecommerce.   Over   the   
past   year,   you've   seen   us   really   focus   on   accelerating,   a   shift   to –   in   terms   of   onboarding   
merchants   across   –   across   Google.   So   we   have   definitely   invested   both   in   terms   of   bringing   
merchants   on   board,   removing   barriers   there,   providing   better   integrations   by   partnering   with  
players,   platform   providers,   across   the   industry.   And   now   we   are   investing   in   our   consumer   
experiences,   be   it   on   Google   Search   or   on   YouTube.   And   so   you   will   see   us   roll   out   features   
over   time.   Philipp,   do   you   want   to   add   more   here?   
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Yes,   look,   there's   a   ton   of   commercial   intent   across   
YouTube.   And   it   was   a   shopping   destination   before   COVID.   I   mean,   think   unboxing   videos,   
product   reviews,   makeup   tutorials,   and   so   on.   And   throughout   the   pandemic   we've   really   seen   
more   shoppers   turn   to   the   platform   for   ideas,   inspiration   and   really   help   them   decide   what   to   
buy.   And   a   number   of   shopping   capabilities   are   already   under   way,   and   we're   working   really   
hard   to   make   it   easier   for   users   to   discover   and   buy   directly   on   YouTube.   And   I   mentioned   how   
merchants   can   globally   add   their   product   feeds   now   right   into   video   action   campaigns.   And   
brands   and   shoppers   alike   are   loving   it.   And   we've   also   begun   beta   testing   this,   for   example,   
with   Discovery   Ads.   And,   yes,   last   quarter   I   mentioned   how   viewers   can   make   purchases   from   
their   favorite   creators,   via   early   experiments   with   Brand   Connect   and   shoppable   product   
shelves.   And   early   adopters   are   seeing   a   lot   of   success   here.   So   stay   tuned   for   more   updates   
later   this   year.   
  
Brent   Thill,   Jefferies:    Great.   Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Mark   Mahaney   with   Evercore   ISI.   Your   
line   is   open.   
  
Mark   Mahaney,   Evercore   ISI:    Thanks.   We’ve   had   record   new-business   formation   in   the   U.S.   
and   I   think   globally   in   the   wake   of   COVID.   And   my   guess   is   that   that's   also   been   a   major   driver   
of   growth   for   you.   Could   you   just   talk   about   that   a   little   bit,   to   the   extent   to   which   you   think   some   
of   these   –   especially   the   advertising   trends   come   from   these   new   businesses   that   are   formed,   
whether   they're   digital,   hybrid,   or   whatever?   And   then,   secondly,   how   do   you   go   from   tens   of   
thousands   of   Waymo   rides   to   millions   of   rides?   Like,   what   are   the   biggest   obstacles   to   that?   
Any   clue   at   all   as   to   how   long   that   takes?   Are   the   issues   more   regulatory?   More   technical?   
Thank   you.     
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Look,   new   businesses,   small   businesses   are   the   
backbone   of   our   economy   here.   But   obviously   local   communities   are   in   varying   stages   of   
recovery.   Some   are   re-opening   while   others   are,   unfortunately,   returning   to   lockdown.   And   we're   
focused   on   continuing   to,   I   would   say,   level   the   playing   field   for   SMBs   here,   and   from   getting   
them   online   and,   frankly,   set   up   for   success   to   giving   them   all   the   digital   tools   they   need   to   get   
discovered   and   be   ready   for   what's   ahead.   This   includes   the   ability   to,   like,   seamlessly   
transition   between   online   and   offline   and   reach   customers   nearby.   Far   beyond   their   local   
neighborhoods   as   well.     
  
So   over   the   past   few   months,   I   mean   literally   just   the   past   few   months,   we've   made   it   easier   for   
SMBs   to   show   their   products   across   Google   for   free,   and   we   added   new   ways   for   them   to   
highlight   in-store   inventory   through   local   inventory   ads.   And   we've   also   made   it   easier   for   them   
to   leverage   the   power   of   YouTube.   They   now   can   create   video   ad   campaigns   literally   within   
12   
minutes   via   their   smartphone.   And   these   are   just   a   few   examples   of   the   ways   we're   helping.   
  
Plus,   also   an   interesting   trend,   people   are   more   eager   than   ever   to   support   their   local   small   
businesses.   Searches   for   "support   local   business"   are   up   like   20x   last   year   in   the   U.S.   alone.   
And   this   is   creating   a   lot   of   opportunity   for   SMBs   overall.   And   I   don't   know,   take   an   example   like   
Ayla   Beauty,   for   example,   it's   a   San Francisco   beauty   brand.   They   made   a   100%   pivot   to   online   
during   the   pandemic   and,   with   insights   into   popular   wellness   and   beauty   searches   in   Google   
Ads,   has   been   really   able   to   grow   their   business   significantly   over   the   last   year.   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    On   Waymo,   as   you   mentioned   in   our   –   in   
Phoenix,   we've   had   very   good   experience   by   scaling   up   rides.   These   are   driverless   rides   and   
no   one   is   in   the   car   other   than   the   passengers.   And   people   have   had   a   very   positive   experience   
overall.   We're   obviously   –   with   a   strong   focus   on   safety,   we're   looking   to   scale   it   up.   Through   it   
all,   we   are   building   newer   capabilities   as   well,   investing   in   next   generation   of   hardware   and   
software.   So   it's   an   iterative   process,   and   at   each   step   it's   very   clear   to   us   that   we   are   ahead   
and   we   are   making   progress.   And   you'll   see   us   continue   to   invest   here   with   a   focus   on   safety   
first.   And   I   expect   us   to   scale   up   more   through   the   course   of   2022.   
  
Mark   Mahaney,   Evercore   ISI:    Thank   you,   Sundar.   Thank   you,   Philipp.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   next   question   comes   from   Michael   Nathanson   with   
MoffettNathanson.   Your   line   is   open.   
  
Michael   Nathanson,   MoffettNathanson:    Great,   thanks.   I   have   one   for   you,   Sundar   and   then   
one   for   Philipp.   Just   a   minute   ago   Philipp   spoke   to   the   acceleration   in   streaming   and   smart   TVs   
worldwide   and   the   importance   that   YouTube   has   on   the   TV   [indiscernible].   I   wanted   to   hear   from   
you   about   your   interest   in   supporting   the   smart   TV   ecosystem,   and   what   do   you   see   as   the   
opportunity   for   Google   in   terms   of   your   product   offerings   to   maybe   improve   consumer   adoption   
of   Connected   TVs?   And   then   for   you,   Philipp,   people   have   been   asking   you   about   Search.   But   
if   you   look   at   Search   from   a   two-year   stack,   the   growth   is   as   high   as   it's   been   in   years.   And   I   
wonder   if   you   can   disaggregate   for   us   the   growth   between   maybe   new   Search   customers   
coming   on   the   platform   versus   increased   spending   on   an   existing   per-customer   basis?   Anything   
to   help   us   on   kind   of   what   drove   it   on   a   client-by-client   basis   on   Search.    
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    On   the   first   question   on   the   smart   TV   ecosystem,   
look,   I   mean,   there   is   a   shift   to   these   becoming   computing   devices   over   time.   They're   going   to   
be   connected   computing   experiences.   People   both   consume   content   passively,   actively,   
including   gaming,   over-the-top   video,   and   so   on.   So   we   view   this   as   part   of   our   platform   shift.   
Android   TV   has   made   tremendous   strides.   It's   a   very   customizable   platform.   We   are   working   
not   only   with   TV   providers   globally,   we   are   doing   it   with   cable-box   manufacturers,   as   well   as   –   
we   supplement   it   with   Google   TV   with   Chromecast   as   well.   So   it's   a   significant   investment   from   
our   side   making   sure   we   can   drive   that   shift.   And   obviously   there   is   a   lot   of   synergies   for   us   in   
terms   of   being   able   to   bring   our   services   to   our   users   as   well   as   give   more   opportunities   for   our   
Play   developers   to   reach   more   users   as   well.   But   definite   strong   integration   points   with   
YouTube   and   YouTube   TV   as   well.     
  
Philipp   Schindler,   SVP   and   CBO,   Google:    Look,   maybe   rather   than   go   into   the   deep   
disaggregation   that   you're   talking   about,   let   me   maybe   talk   a   little   about   how   we   think   about   the   
13   
overall   market   for   Search   and   the   addressable   market.   In   the   last   call,   last   quarter,   I   gave   you   a   
little   bit   of   a   breakdown   here.   But   what   is   really   important   is   we're   not   just   addressing  
above-the-line   marketing   budgets,   which   has   different   metrics   around it,   but   let's   say   around   
half   a   trillion   dollars,   which   is   traditional   advertising,   TV   advertising,   and   so   on.   There   is   also   
significant   upside   on   below-the-line   budgets   overall,   like   promotional   pricing,   product   
placement,   sponsorships,   and   so   on.     
  
And   sure,   we've   seen   COVID   accelerate   the   shift   to   ecommerce   at   an   astounding   rate,   but   keep   
also   in   mind   80%   of   commerce   still   remains   offline.   So   there's   a   lot   of   room   for   digital   to   play   a   
bigger   role   in,   and   we   think   we   can   tap   into   other   budgets   that   were   traditionally   used   for,   let's   
say,   local   advertising   to   drive   sales.     
  
And   as   we   think   about   our   long   runway   for   growth,   we   also   think,   obviously,   about   improving   
user   and   advertiser   experiences   for   years   to   come   here.   And   we're   constantly   asking   ourselves,   
how   do   we   direct   better   answers   to   queries,   including   those   with   commercial   intent?   And   how   
do   we   use   our   ML   to   deliver   even   more   relevant   and   higher   quality   experiences   for   users?   And   
our   primary   focus   is   really   on   delivering   great   experiences   for   our   users   and   driving   incremental   
value   for   our   partners   and   making   them   successful.   And   I   think   as   long   as   we   do   this,   we   
should   continue   to   see   budgets   move   our   way.   
  
Michael   Nathanson,   MoffettNathanson:    Okay.   Thank   you   both.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   Our   last   question   comes   from   Jason   Bazinet   with   Citi.   Your   line   is   open.   
  
Jason   Bazinet,   Citi:    I   just   had   one   question.   Maybe   it   dovetails   off   of   what   you   just   said,   but   if   I   
take   your   ad   dollars,   this   quarter   $50   billion   and   annualize,   it's   like   $200   billion   a   year.   Are   you   
or   the   board   focused   at   all   on   trying   to   diversify   away   from   the   ad   market   or   do   you   just   feel   like   
there's   so   much   runway   that   there   is   no   real   reason   to   stay   focused   on   non-ad-based   growth?   
  
Sundar   Pichai,   CEO   Alphabet   and   Google:    Look,   at   a   high   level,   we   –   multiple   parts   to   your   
question.   Obviously,   we   are   very   focused   on   –   we   have   a   mission,   we   have   an   approach   of   
being   helpful   across   certain   important   attributes,   and   we   do   deep   investments   in   computer   
science   and   AI   to   build   services.   And   out   of   that,   naturally   there's   diversification   over   time.   
When   you   look   at   YouTube   as   contributing   to   that,   you   look   at   Cloud,   and   within   Cloud   we   have   
both   GCP   and   Workspace   contributing   to   that,   and   longer-term   we   have   efforts   like   Waymo   as   
well.   Beyond   that,   as   both   Philipp   and   Ruth   have   spoken   about,   with   this   digital   shift,   we   see   a   
lot   of   headroom   in   terms   of   where   –   market   for   either   advertising   or   ecommerce,   and   so   we   see   
a   lot   of   headroom   there   as   well.   
  
So   we   take   a   long-term   view.   We   start   from   first   principles   towards   focusing   on   both   investing   in   
deep   technology   and   solving   user   problems.   And   out   of   that   I   think   you   have   a   set   of   diversified   
models   that   emerge,   both   different   types   of   businesses   and   also   within   a   business.   For   
example,   in   YouTube,   we   have   both   ads   and   subscription   over   time.   And   so   I   think   we'll   
continue   approaching   it   that   way   with   an   eye   for   the   long-term.   
  
Jason   Bazinet,   Citi:    Thank   you.   
  
Operator:    Thank   you.   And   that   concludes   our   question-and-answer   session   for   today.   I'd   like   to   
14   
turn   the   conference   back   over   to   Jim   Friedland   for   any   further   remarks.   
  
Jim   Friedland,   Director   Investor   Relations:    Thanks,   everyone,   for   joining   us   today.   We   look   
forward   to   speaking   with   you   again   on   our   third   quarter   2021   call.   Thank   you,   and   have   a   good   
evening.     
  
Operator:    Thank   you,   everyone.   This   concludes   today's   conference   call.   Thank   you   for   
participating.   You   may   now   disconnect.
