Good
 
afternoon,
 
everyone,
 
and
 
welcome
 
to
 
Alphabet's
 
Second
 
Quarter
 
2025
 
Earnings
 
Conference
 
Call.
 
With
 
us
 
today
 
are
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
and
 
Anat
 
Ashkenazi.
 
 
Now,
 
I'll
 
quickly
 
cover
 
the
 
Safe
 
Harbor .
 
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
statements
 
that
 
we
 
make
 
today
 
regarding
 
our
 
business,
 
operations,
 
and
 
financial
 
performance
 
may
 
be
 
considered
 
forward-looking.
 
Such
 
statements
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
current
 
expectations
 
and
 
assumptions
 
that
 
are
 
subject
 
to
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
risks
 
and
 
uncertainties.
 
 
Actual
 
results
 
could
 
differ
 
materially .
 
Please
 
refer
 
to
 
our
 
Forms
 
10-K
 
and
 
10-Q,
 
including
 
the
 
risk
 
factors.
 
We
 
undertake
 
no
 
obligation
 
to
 
update
 
any
 
forward-looking
 
statement.
 
 
During
 
this
 
call,
 
we
 
will
 
present
 
both
 
GAAP
 
and
 
non-GAAP
 
financial
 
measures.
 
A
 
reconciliation
 
of
 
non-GAAP
 
to
 
GAAP
 
measures
 
is
 
included
 
in
 
today's
 
earnings
 
press
 
release,
 
which
 
is
 
distributed
 
and
 
available
 
to
 
the
 
public
 
through
 
our
 
Investor
 
Relations
 
website
 
located
 
at
 
abc.xyz/investor .
 
 
Our
 
comments
 
will
 
be
 
on
 
year-over-year
 
comparisons
 
unless
 
we
 
state
 
otherwise.
 
 
And
 
now,
 
I'll
 
turn
 
the
 
call
 
over
 
to
 
Sundar .
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Thanks,
 
Jim.
 
 
1
 
 
 
Good
 
afternoon,
 
everyone.
 
 
Q2
 
was
 
a
 
standout
 
quarter
 
for
 
us,
 
with
 
robust
 
growth
 
across
 
the
 
company .
 
As
 
you
 
saw
 
at
 
I/O,
 
we
 
are
 
leading
 
at
 
the
 
frontier
 
of
 
AI
 
and
 
shipping
 
at
 
an
 
incredible
 
pace.
 
AI
 
is
 
positively
 
impacting
 
every
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
business,
 
driving
 
strong
 
momentum.
 
 
 
This
 
quarter ,
 
Search
 
delivered
 
double-digit
 
revenue
 
growth.
 
Our
 
new
 
Search
 
features
 
continue
 
to
 
perform
 
well.
 
AI
 
Mode
 
has
 
launched
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
and
 
India,
 
and
 
is
 
going
 
well.
 
While
 
AI
 
Overviews
 
now
 
has
 
over
 
2 billion
 
monthly
 
users
 
across
 
more
 
than
 
200
 
countries
 
and
 
territories
 
and
 
40
 
languages.
 
I'll
 
give
 
some
 
more
 
details
 
on
 
Search
 
in
 
a
 
moment.
 
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
see
 
strong
 
performance
 
in
 
YouTube,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
Subscriptions,
 
reflecting
 
great
 
momentum
 
across
 
these
 
high-growth
 
businesses.
 
In
 
the
 
U.S.,
 
Shorts
 
now
 
earn
 
as
 
much
 
revenue
 
per
 
watch
 
hour
 
as
 
traditional
 
in-stream
 
on
 
YouTube,
 
and
 
in
 
some
 
countries,
 
it
 
now
 
even
 
exceeds
 
in-stream's
 
rate.
 
 
Cloud
 
had
 
another
 
great
 
quarter
 
of
 
strong
 
growth
 
in
 
revenues,
 
backlog,
 
and
 
profitability .
 
Its
 
annual
 
revenue
 
run
 
rate
 
is
 
now
 
more
 
than
 
$50
 
billion.
 
We
 
are
 
seeing
 
significant
 
demand
 
for
 
our
 
comprehensive
 
AI
 
product
 
portfolio.
 
 
Of
 
course,
 
this
 
is
 
all
 
possible
 
because
 
of
 
the
 
long-term
 
investments
 
we've
 
made
 
in
 
our
 
differentiated,
 
full-stack
 
approach
 
to
 
AI.
 
This
 
spans
 
AI
 
infrastructure;
 
world-class
 
research,
 
models
 
and
 
tooling;
 
and
 
our
 
products
 
and
 
platforms
 
that
 
bring
 
AI
 
to
 
people
 
all
 
over
 
the
 
world.
 
 
I'll
 
briefly
 
touch
 
on
 
the
 
AI
 
stack
 
before
 
turning
 
to
 
quarterly
 
highlights.
 
 
First,
 
AI
 
infrastructure.
 
We
 
operate
 
the
 
leading
 
global
 
network
 
of
 
AI-optimized
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
cloud
 
regions.
 
 
We
 
also
 
offer
 
the
 
industry's
 
widest
 
range
 
of
 
TPUs
 
and
 
GPUs,
 
along
 
with
 
storage
 
and
 
software
 
built
 
on
 
top.
 
That's
 
why
 
nearly
 
all
 
gen
 
AI
 
unicorns
 
use
 
Google
 
Cloud.
 
And
 
it's
 
why
 
a
 
growing
 
number ,
 
including
 
leading
 
AI
 
research
 
labs,
 
like
 
Safe
 
Super
 
Intelligence
 
and
 
Physical
 
Intelligence,
 
use
 
TPUs
 
specifically .
 
Our
 
AI
 
infrastructure
 
investments
 
are
 
crucial
 
to
 
meeting
 
the
 
growth
 
in
 
demand
 
from
 
Cloud
 
customers.
 
 
Next,
 
world-class
 
AI
 
research,
 
including
 
models
 
and
 
tooling.
 
 
2
 
 
We
 
continue
 
to
 
expand
 
our
 
Gemini
 
2.5
 
family
 
of
 
hybrid
 
reasoning
 
models,
 
which
 
provide
 
industry-leading
 
performance
 
in
 
nearly
 
every
 
major
 
benchmark.
 
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
improving
 
our
 
popular
 
workhorse
 
model
 
Flash,
 
we
 
debuted
 
an
 
extremely
 
fast
 
‘Flash-Lite’
 
version.
 
 
We
 
achieved
 
gold-medal
 
level
 
performance
 
in
 
the
 
International
 
Math
 
Olympiad,
 
using
 
an
 
advanced
 
version
 
of
 
Gemini
 
with
 
Deep
 
Think.
 
We
 
can't
 
wait
 
to
 
bring
 
Deep
 
Think
 
to
 
users
 
soon.
 
 
We
 
have
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
best
 
models
 
available
 
today
 
at
 
every
 
price
 
point.
 
Our
 
2.5
 
models
 
have
 
been
 
a
 
catalyst
 
for
 
growth,
 
and
 
nine
 
million
 
developers
 
have
 
now
 
built
 
with
 
Gemini.
 
 
I
 
also
 
want
 
to
 
mention
 
Veo
 
3,
 
our
 
state-of-the-art
 
video
 
generation
 
model.
 
It's
 
been
 
a
 
viral
 
hit,
 
with
 
people
 
sharing
 
clips
 
created
 
in
 
the
 
Gemini
 
app,
 
and
 
with
 
our
 
new
 
AI
 
filmmaking
 
tool,
 
Flow.
 
Since
 
May,
 
over
 
70
 
million
 
videos
 
have
 
been
 
generated
 
using
 
Veo
 
3.
 
 
And
 
we
 
recently
 
introduced
 
a
 
feature
 
in
 
the
 
Gemini
 
app
 
to
 
turn
 
photos
 
into
 
videos,
 
which
 
people
 
absolutely
 
love.
 
It's
 
also
 
rolling
 
out
 
to
 
Google
 
Photos
 
users
 
starting
 
today .
 
 
Third,
 
our
 
products
 
and
 
platforms.
 
We
 
are
 
bringing
 
AI
 
to
 
all
 
our
 
users
 
and
 
partners
 
through
 
surfaces
 
like
 
Workspace,
 
Chrome,
 
and
 
more.
 
The
 
growth
 
in
 
usage
 
has
 
been
 
incredible.
 
 
At
 
I/O
 
in
 
May,
 
we
 
announced
 
that
 
we
 
processed
 
480
 
trillion
 
monthly
 
tokens
 
across
 
our
 
surfaces.
 
Since
 
then,
 
we
 
have
 
doubled
 
that
 
number
 
now
 
processing
 
over
 
980
 
trillion
 
monthly
 
tokens,
 
a
 
remarkable
 
increase.
 
 
The
 
Gemini
 
app
 
now
 
has
 
more
 
than
 
450
 
million
 
monthly
 
active
 
users
 
and
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
see
 
strong
 
growth
 
and
 
engagement,
 
with
 
daily
 
requests
 
growing
 
over
 
50%
 
from
 
Q1.
 
 
In
 
June
 
alone,
 
over
 
50
 
million
 
people
 
used
 
AI-powered
 
meeting
 
notes
 
in
 
Google
 
Meet.
 
 
And
 
powered
 
by
 
Veo
 
3,
 
our
 
new
 
short
 
video
 
product
 
in
 
Workspace
 
called
 
Google
 
Vids
 
reached
 
nearly
 
one
 
million
 
monthly
 
active
 
users.
 
 
This
 
month
 
at
 
Samsung
 
Galaxy
 
Unpacked,
 
we
 
announced
 
new
 
Android
 
and
 
AI
 
features
 
that
 
are
 
available
 
on
 
Samsung's
 
latest
 
devices.
 
3
 
 
 
And
 
we
 
are
 
really
 
pleased
 
with
 
the
 
growth
 
in
 
Subscriptions,
 
which
 
got
 
a
 
boost
 
from
 
our
 
Google
 
AI
 
Pro
 
and
 
Ultra
 
plans.
 
 
Now,
 
some
 
key
 
highlights
 
from
 
Search,
 
Cloud,
 
YouTube,
 
and
 
Waymo
 
for
 
the
 
quarter .
 
 
First
 
up,
 
this
 
is
 
an
 
incredibly
 
exciting
 
moment
 
for
 
Search.
 
We
 
see
 
AI
 
powering
 
an
 
expansion
 
in
 
how
 
people
 
are
 
searching
 
for
 
and
 
accessing
 
information,
 
unlocking
 
completely
 
new
 
kinds
 
of
 
questions
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
Google.
 
 
Overall
 
queries
 
and
 
commercial
 
queries
 
on
 
Search
 
continued
 
to
 
grow
 
year-over-year .
 
And
 
our
 
new
 
AI
 
experiences
 
significantly
 
contributed
 
to
 
this
 
increase
 
in
 
usage.
 
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
seeing
 
that
 
our
 
AI
 
features
 
cause
 
users
 
to
 
search
 
more
 
as
 
they
 
learn
 
that
 
Search
 
can
 
meet
 
more
 
of
 
their
 
needs.
 
That's
 
especially
 
true
 
for
 
younger
 
users.
 
 
Let
 
me
 
go
 
deeper
 
on
 
our
 
new
 
Search
 
experiences.
 
 
We
 
know
 
how
 
popular
 
AI
 
Overviews
 
are
 
because
 
they
 
are
 
now
 
driving
 
over
 
10%
 
more
 
queries
 
globally
 
for
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
queries
 
that
 
show
 
them,
 
and
 
this
 
growth
 
continues
 
to
 
increase
 
over
 
time.
 
AI
 
Overviews
 
are
 
now
 
powered
 
by
 
Gemini
 
2.5,
 
delivering
 
the
 
fastest
 
AI
 
responses
 
in
 
the
 
industry .
 
 
We
 
also
 
saw
 
strong
 
growth
 
in
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
multimodal
 
Search,
 
particularly
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
Lens
 
or
 
Circle
 
to
 
Search,
 
together
 
with
 
AI
 
Overviews.
 
This
 
growth
 
was
 
most
 
pronounced
 
among
 
younger
 
users.
 
 
Our
 
new
 
end-to-end
 
AI
 
Search
 
experience,
 
AI
 
Mode,
 
continues
 
to
 
receive
 
very
 
positive
 
feedback,
 
particularly
 
for
 
longer
 
and
 
more
 
complex
 
questions.
 
It's
 
still
 
rolling
 
out
 
but
 
already
 
has
 
over
 
100
 
million
 
monthly
 
active
 
users
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
and
 
India.
 
 
We
 
plan
 
to
 
keep
 
enhancing
 
the
 
AI
 
Mode
 
experience
 
for
 
users
 
by
 
shipping
 
great
 
features,
 
fast.
 
That
 
includes
 
our
 
advanced
 
research
 
tool
  
Deep
 
Search
 
and
 
more
 
personalized
 
responses.
 
 
Next,
 
Google
 
Cloud.
 
 
We
 
see
 
strong
 
customer
 
demand,
 
driven
 
by
 
our
 
product
 
differentiation
 
and
 
our
 
comprehensive
 
AI
 
product
 
portfolio.
 
Four
 
stats
 
show
 
this.
 
 
4
 
 
One,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
deals
 
over
 
$250
 
million,
 
doubling
 
year-over-year .
 
 
Two,
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
of
 
2025,
 
we
 
signed
 
the
 
same
 
number
 
of
 
deals
 
over
 
$1
 
billion
 
that
 
we
 
did
 
in
 
all
 
of
 
2024.
 
 
Three,
 
the
 
number
 
of
 
new
 
GCP
 
customers
 
increased
 
by
 
nearly
 
28%
 
quarter-over-quarter .
 
 
Four,
 
more
 
than
 
85,000
 
enterprises
 
including:
 
LVMH,
 
Salesforce,
 
and
 
Singapore's
 
DBS
 
Bank
 
now
 
build
 
with
 
Gemini,
 
driving
 
a
 
35x
 
growth
 
in
 
Gemini
 
usage
 
year-over-year .
 
 
Our
 
models
 
are
 
served
 
on
 
our
 
AI
 
infrastructure,
 
which
 
offers
 
industry-leading
 
performance
 
and
 
cost
 
efficiency
 
for
 
both
 
training
 
and
 
inference.
 
 
Along
 
with
 
our
 
AI
 
accelerators,
 
we
 
introduced
 
new
 
innovations
 
in
 
storage,
 
including
 
Anywhere
 
Cache,
 
which
 
improves
 
inference
 
latency
 
by
 
up
 
to
 
70%;
 
and
 
Rapid
 
Storage,
 
which
 
delivers
 
a
 
5x
 
improvement
 
in
 
latency
 
compared
 
to
 
leading
 
hyperscalers.
 
 
In
 
addition,
 
we
 
have
 
optimized
 
AI
 
software
 
packages,
 
including
 
PyTorch
 
and
 
JAX,
 
with
 
full
 
open
 
source
 
supports
 
for
 
various
 
AI
 
training
 
and
 
serving
 
demands.
 
 
We
 
have
 
also
 
integrated
 
AI
 
agents
 
deeply
 
into
 
each
 
of
 
our
 
Cloud
 
products.
 
 
Wayfair
 
is
 
leveraging
 
our
 
databases
 
integrated
 
with
 
AI
 
to
 
streamline
 
data
 
pipelines
 
and
 
deliver
 
more
 
personalized
 
customer
 
experiences.
 
 
Mattel
 
is
 
leveraging
 
our
 
Gemini-powered
 
Data
 
Agents
 
and
 
Big
 
Query
 
to
 
review
 
and
 
act
 
on
 
product
 
feedback
 
more
 
quickly .
 
 
Target
 
is
 
using
 
our
 
Gemini-powered
 
Threat
 
Intelligence
 
and
 
Security
 
Operations
 
Agents
 
to
 
improve
 
cybersecurity .
 
 
Capgemini
 
is
 
utilizing
 
our
 
AI
 
Software
 
Engineering
 
Agents
 
to
 
deliver
 
higher
 
quality
 
software
 
faster
 
by
 
automating
 
tasks,
 
from
 
code
 
generation
 
to
 
testing.
 
 
And
 
BBVA
 
says
 
Gemini
 
in
 
Google
 
Workspace
 
is
 
saving
 
employees
 
nearly
 
three
 
hours
 
per
 
week
 
by
 
automating
 
repetitive
 
tasks.
 
It
 
is
 
now
 
rolling
 
it
 
out
 
to
 
100,000
 
employees
 
globally .
 
 
We
 
are
 
also
 
focused
 
on
 
building
 
a
 
flourishing
 
AI
 
agent
 
ecosystem.
 
5
 
 
 
We
 
introduced
 
an
 
open
 
source
 
Agent
 
Development
 
Kit
 
which
 
now
 
has
 
over
 
a
 
million
 
downloads
 
in
 
less
 
than
 
four
 
months.
 
 
We
 
also
 
introduced
 
Agentspace,
 
an
 
open
 
and
 
interoperable
 
enterprise
 
chat,
 
search
 
and
 
agent
 
platform.
 
Gordon
 
Food
 
Service
 
is
 
bringing
 
Agentspace
 
to
 
its
 
U.S.
 
employees,
 
which
 
is
 
enabling
 
better ,
 
more
 
efficient
 
decision-making.
 
And
 
over
 
one
 
million
 
subscriptions
 
have
 
been
 
booked
 
for
 
Agentspace
 
ahead
 
of
 
its
 
general
 
availability .
 
 
Turning
 
now
 
to
 
YouTube.
 
Nielsen
 
data
 
shows
 
YouTube
 
has
 
led
 
U.S.
 
streaming
 
watch
 
time
 
for
 
over
 
two
 
years.
 
A
 
generation
 
that
 
grew
 
up
 
with
 
YouTube
 
on
 
their
 
devices
 
is
 
now
 
increasingly
 
watching
 
their
 
favorite
 
creators
 
and
 
content
 
on
 
their
 
televisions.
 
 
That
 
includes
 
billions
 
of
 
sports
 
fans,
 
too.
 
Globally
 
they
 
consume
 
more
 
than
 
40
 
billion
 
hours
 
of
 
sports
 
content
 
on
 
YouTube
 
annually .
 
And
 
in
 
September ,
 
we'll
 
stream
 
the
 
NFL's
 
first
 
Friday
 
game
 
of
 
the
 
season,
 
live
 
from
 
Brazil.
 
From
 
Sports
 
to
 
Shorts,
 
we
 
now
 
average
 
over
 
200
 
billion
 
daily
 
views
 
on
 
YouTube
 
Shorts.
 
 
AI
 
is
 
helping
 
improve
 
our
 
recommendations
 
and
 
Auto
 
Dubbing,
 
which
 
translates
 
to
 
better
 
returns
 
for
 
creators
 
and
 
brands
 
by
 
dramatically
 
increasing
 
the
 
potential
 
audiences
 
they
 
can
 
reach.
 
And
 
today ,
 
we
 
began
 
rolling
 
out
 
a
 
whole
 
raft
 
of
 
new
 
AI
 
tools
 
for
 
creators
 
on
 
YouTube
 
Shorts.
 
 
Finally ,
 
YouTube
 
continues
 
to
 
diversify
 
its
 
subscription
 
options,
 
recently
 
expanding
 
its
 
Premium
 
Lite
 
offerings
 
to
 
15
 
new
 
countries,
 
with
 
more
 
to
 
come.
 
 
And
 
lastly ,
 
Waymo
 
continues
 
to
 
scale
 
and
 
expand
 
to
 
safely
 
serve
 
more
 
riders
 
in
 
more
 
places.
 
 
Last
 
month,
 
Waymo
 
launched
 
in
 
Atlanta,
 
more
 
than
 
doubled
 
its
 
Austin
 
service
 
territory ,
 
and
 
expanded
 
its
 
Los
 
Angeles
 
and
 
San
 
Francisco
 
Bay
 
Area
 
territories
 
by
 
approximately
 
50%.
 
 
Waymo
 
also
 
launched
 
Teen
 
Accounts,
 
starting
 
with
 
riders
 
aged
 
14-17
 
in
 
Phoenix.
 
 
Overall,
 
great
 
momentum
 
here.
 
The
 
Waymo
 
Driver
 
has
 
now
 
autonomously
 
driven
 
over
 
100
 
million
 
miles
 
on
 
public
 
roads.
 
And
 
the
 
team
 
is
 
testing
 
across
 
more
 
than
 
ten
 
cities
 
this
 
year,
 
including
 
New
 
York
 
and
 
Philadelphia.
 
We
 
hope
 
to
 
serve
 
riders
 
in
 
all
 
ten
 
in
 
the
 
future.

As
 
I
 
said,
 
a
 
standout
 
quarter .
 
A
 
big
 
thank
 
you,
 
as
 
always,
 
to
 
our
 
employees
 
and
 
partners
 
for
 
an
 
amazing
 
Q2.
 
 
Philipp,
 
over
 
to
 
you.
 
 
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CBO,
 
Google:
 
Thanks,
 
Sundar .
 
And
 
hello,
 
everyone.
 
 
I'll
 
quickly
 
cover
 
performance
 
for
 
Google
 
Services
 
for
 
the
 
quarter ,
 
then
 
structure
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
my
 
remarks
 
around
 
the
 
great
 
progress
 
we
 
are
 
delivering
 
across
 
Search,
 
Ads,
 
YouTube,
 
and
 
Partnerships.
 
 
Google
 
Services
 
revenues
 
were
 
$83
 
billion
 
for
 
the
 
quarter ,
 
up
 
12%
 
year-on-year ,
 
driven
 
by
 
strong
 
growth
 
in
 
Search
 
and
 
YouTube,
 
partially
 
offset
 
by
 
a
 
year-on-year
 
decline
 
in
 
Network
 
revenues.
 
 
To
 
add
 
some
 
further
 
color
 
to
 
our
 
results,
 
the
 
12%
 
increase
 
in
 
Search
 
and
 
Other
 
revenues
 
was
 
led
 
by
 
growth
 
across
 
all
 
verticals,
 
with
 
the
 
largest
 
contributions
 
from
 
Retail
 
and
 
Financial
 
Services.
 
 
YouTube
 
saw
 
similar
 
performance
 
across
 
verticals.
 
Its
 
13%
 
growth
 
in
 
advertising
 
revenues
 
was
 
driven
 
by
 
Direct
 
Response,
 
followed
 
by
 
Brand.
 
 
Starting
 
with
 
Search
 
and
 
Other
 
revenues,
 
which
 
delivered
 
over
 
$54
 
billion
 
in
 
revenue
 
for
 
the
 
quarter .
 
 
Shifts
 
like
 
AI
 
are
 
what
 
propels
 
our
 
industry
 
forward.
 
Gemini's
 
native
 
multimodality
 
is
 
helping
 
bring
 
the
 
offline
 
audio
 
and
 
visual
 
world
 
back
 
into
 
the
 
online
 
world,
 
creating
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
opportunities
 
for
 
Search.
 
Let
 
me
 
share
 
a
 
few
 
examples.
 
 
Take
 
visual
 
queries.
 
Google
 
Lens
 
searches
 
are
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
fastest
 
growing
 
query
 
types
 
on
 
Search
 
and
 
grew
 
70%
 
since
 
this
 
time
 
last
 
year.
 
The
 
majority
 
of
 
Lens
 
searches
 
are
 
incremental,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
seeing
 
healthy
 
growth
 
with
 
shopping
 
queries
 
using
 
Lens.
 
And
 
you
 
can
 
obviously
 
take
 
this
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
level
 
by
 
moving
 
from
 
image
 
to
 
video-based
 
capabilities,
 
like
 
‘Search
 
Live’.
 
 
And
 
then
 
there's
 
Circle
 
to
 
Search,
 
which
 
is
 
now
 
on
 
over
 
300
 
million
 
Android
 
devices.
 
We've
 
been
 
adding
 
capabilities
 
to
 
help
 
people
 
explore
 
complex
 
topics
 
and
 
ask
 
follow-up
 
questions
 
without
 
switching
 
apps.
 
For
 
example,
 
gamers
 
can
 
now
 
use
 
Circle
 
to
 
Search
 
while
 
playing
 
mobile
 
games
 
to
 
see
 
an
 
AI
 
Overview
 
for
 
answers.
 
 
7
 
 
And
 
just
 
last
 
week,
 
we
 
brought
 
a
 
new,
 
agentic
 
capability
 
directly
 
into
 
Search
 
for
 
all
 
U.S.
 
users
 
with
 
AI-powered
 
calling
 
to
 
local
 
businesses.
 
 
Finally ,
 
Shopping,
 
where
 
in
 
Q2
 
we
 
introduced
 
a
 
virtual
 
try-on
 
experience
 
for
 
Search
 
Labs
 
users
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
Now
 
people
 
can
 
try
 
billions
 
of
 
clothing
 
products
 
on
 
themselves,
 
virtually .
 
Early
 
results
 
and
 
engagement
 
have
 
been
 
extremely
 
positive,
 
particularly
 
with
 
Gen
 
Z
 
users,
 
and
 
we'll
 
be
 
bringing
 
this
 
functionality
 
to
 
all
 
U.S.
 
users
 
imminently .
 
 
All
 
these
 
innovations
 
are
 
opening
 
up
 
completely
 
new
 
ways
 
for
 
people
 
to
 
use
 
technology ,
 
bringing
 
the
 
offline
 
world
 
into
 
the
 
online
 
world
 
in
 
ways
 
that
 
simply
 
have
 
not
 
been
 
possible
 
before.
 
Add
 
in
 
our
 
amazing
 
AI
 
translation
 
capabilities
 
and
 
just
 
imagine
 
the
 
possibilities:
 
people
 
can
 
access
 
more
 
content
 
in
 
their
 
language,
 
and
 
businesses
 
-
 
large
 
and
 
small,
 
international
 
or
 
local
 
-
 
can
 
reach
 
even
 
more
 
customers.
 
 
I'm
 
excited
 
about
 
how
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
elements
 
will
 
come
 
together
 
and
 
the
 
opportunities
 
ahead
 
of
 
us
 
in
 
Search.
 
 
Moving
 
to
 
Ads,
 
where
 
our
 
strategy
 
to
 
reinvent
 
the
 
entire
 
marketing
 
process
 
with
 
AI
 
is
 
delivering
 
value
 
for
 
our
 
customers
 
and
 
our
 
business.
 
 
Last
 
quarter ,
 
we
 
introduced
 
AI
 
Max
 
in
 
Search,
 
a
 
new
 
suite
 
of
 
AI-powered
 
features
 
in
 
existing
 
Search
 
campaigns.
 
Advertisers
 
that
 
activate
 
AI
 
Max
 
in
 
Search
 
campaigns
 
typically
 
see
 
14%
 
more
 
conversions.
 
 
On
 
Media
 
Buying,
 
Smart
 
Bidding
 
Exploration,
 
the
 
biggest
 
update
 
to
 
bidding
 
strategy
 
in
 
a
 
decade,
 
brings
 
better
 
performance
 
to
 
advertisers
 
by
 
allowing
 
them
 
to
 
bid
 
on
 
less
 
obvious,
 
but
 
potentially
 
higher
 
value
 
queries
 
more
 
often.
 
Campaigns
 
using
 
Smart
 
Bidding
 
Exploration
 
see
 
a
 
19%
 
increase
 
in
 
conversions
 
on
 
average.
 
 
Demand
 
Gen
 
continues
 
to
 
drive
 
revenue
 
growth
 
and
 
deliver
 
measurable
 
impact
 
for
 
our
 
customers.
 
As
 
an
 
example,
 
Depop,
 
Etsy's
 
resale
 
clothing
 
marketplace,
 
used
 
a
 
Shorts-only
 
Demand
 
Gen
 
campaign
 
to
 
drive
 
new
 
customers
 
to
 
the
 
site.
 
Shorts
 
drove
 
80%
 
higher
 
brand
 
lift
 
and
 
doubled
 
click-through
 
rates
 
versus
 
benchmarks.
 
 
On
 
Creatives,
 
we
 
launched
 
Asset
 
Studio
 
using
 
our
 
latest
 
models
 
to
 
help
 
businesses,
 
large
 
and
 
small,
 
generate
 
creative
 
assets.
 
Small
 
businesses
 
benefit
 
from
 
top
 
quality
 
assets
 
and
 
deployment
 
scaling
 
capabilities,
 
while
 
larger
 
businesses
 
can
 
go
 
faster
 
from
 
proof
 
of
 
concept,
 
to
 
launch,
 
and
 
resize
 
at
 
lower
 
costs.
 
Over
 
2 million
 
advertisers
 
now
 
use
 
Google's
 
AI-powered
 
asset
 
generation
 
tools
 
to
 
run
 
ads.
 
A
 
50%
 
increase
 
on
 
this
 
time
 
last
 
year.
 
8
 
 
 
Turning
 
to
 
YouTube,
 
where
 
we
 
saw
 
continued
 
strong
 
revenue
 
growth,
 
driven
 
by
 
Direct
 
Response
 
followed
 
by
 
Brand.
 
 
 
YouTube
 
creators
 
are
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
global
 
zeitgeist
 
and
 
trusted
 
by
 
their
 
audiences
 
like
 
no
 
others.
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
Brand
 
Connect,
 
we
 
launched
 
Creator
 
Partnership
 
Hub
 
which
 
allows
 
brands
 
to
 
more
 
easily
 
work
 
with
 
the
 
right
 
creators
 
and
 
tap
 
into
 
cultural
 
moments.
 
 
We
 
introduced
 
Veo
 
3,
 
photo
 
to
 
video
 
and
 
generative
 
effects
 
to
 
Shorts,
 
making
 
content
 
creation
 
easier
 
and
 
offering
 
unexplored
 
avenues
 
for
 
creativity .
 
 
We're
 
seeing
 
both
 
the
 
volume
 
and
 
the
 
price
 
of
 
ads
 
in
 
Shorts
 
increase,
 
particularly
 
in
 
developed
 
markets.
 
The
 
feed-based
 
nature
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
allows
 
for
 
more
 
ad
 
opportunities
 
on
 
average,
 
and
 
this
 
growth
 
is
 
further
 
supported
 
by
 
ad
 
formats
 
native
 
to
 
Shorts,
 
AI-powered
 
ad
 
creative
 
resizing
 
tools,
 
improved
 
ad
 
targeting,
 
and
 
the
 
rise
 
in
 
viewer
 
engagement.
 
 
McDonald's
 
USA
 
harnessed
 
the
 
influence
 
of
 
YouTube
 
creators
 
to
 
ignite
 
awareness
 
for
 
the
 
Minecraft
 
Movie
 
Meal.
 
It
 
leveraged
 
YouTube
 
Shorts
 
partnership
 
ads
 
to
 
increase
 
its
 
reach,
 
generating
 
a
 
3.3x
 
higher
 
viewthrough
 
rate
 
than
 
the
 
industry
 
benchmark.
 
 
Finally ,
 
on
 
CTV,
 
where
 
the
 
momentum
 
continues.
 
According
 
to
 
The
 
Gauge
 
report
 
by
 
Nielsen,
 
YouTube
 
has
 
been
 
number
 
one
 
in
 
streaming
 
watch
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
U.S.
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
two
 
years,
 
hitting
 
a
 
record
 
high
 
of
 
12.8%
 
of
 
total
 
TV
 
viewing
 
in
 
June
 
2025.
 
 
In
 
the
 
past
 
12
 
months,
 
YouTube
 
ads
 
viewed
 
on
 
CTV
 
screens
 
drove
 
over
 
one
 
billion
 
conversions.
 
We
 
saw
 
strong
 
growth
 
in
 
Retail
 
thanks
 
to
 
CTV
 
shopping
 
ads
 
which
 
allows
 
viewers
 
to
 
shop
 
directly
 
via
 
QR
 
codes,
 
helping
 
us
 
leverage
 
direct
 
marketing
 
opportunities.
 
 
As
 
always,
 
I'll
 
wrap
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
momentum
 
we
 
are
 
seeing
 
in
 
Partnerships,
 
where
 
our
 
customers
 
increasingly
 
recognize
 
the
 
strength
 
and
 
breadth
 
of
 
Google's
 
ability
 
to
 
help
 
them
 
transform
 
their
 
business
 
with
 
AI.
 
 
For
 
instance,
 
a
 
new
 
partnership
 
with
 
PayPal
 
will
 
improve
 
the
 
digital
 
commerce
 
experience
 
for
 
their
 
merchants
 
and
 
customers.
 
PayPal
 
will
 
expand
 
its
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
adoption
 
for
 
AI-driven
 
recommendations,
 
transaction
 
processing,
 
and
 
enhanced
 
security .
 
The
 
partnership
 
also
 
broadens
 
the
 
availability
 
and
 
functionality
 
of
 
PayPal's
 
payment
 
services
 
and
 
capabilities
 
across
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
Google
 
products.

In
 
closing,
 
I'd
 
like
 
to
 
thank
 
Googlers
 
everywhere
 
for
 
their
 
contributions
 
and
 
commitment
 
to
 
our
 
success,
 
and
 
to
 
our
 
customers
 
and
 
partners
 
for
 
their
 
continued
 
trust.
 
 
Anat,
 
over
 
to
 
you!
 
 
Anat
 
Ashkenazi,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CFO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
  
Thank
 
you,
 
Philipp.
 
 
 
My
 
comments
 
will
 
focus
 
on
 
year-over-year
 
comparisons
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
unless
 
I
 
state
 
otherwise.
 
 
 
I
 
will
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
results
 
at
 
the
 
Alphabet
 
level,
 
and
 
will
 
then
 
cover
 
our
 
segment
 
results.
 
I'll
 
end
 
with
 
some
 
commentary
 
on
 
our
 
outlook
 
for
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025.
 
 
We
 
have
 
another
 
solid
 
quarter
 
in
 
Q2.
 
Consolidated
 
revenues
 
of
 
$96.4 billion
 
increased
 
by
 
14%,
 
or
 
13%
 
in
 
constant
 
currency .
 
 
Search
 
and
 
YouTube
 
advertising;
 
Subscriptions,
 
Platforms
 
and
 
Devices;
 
and
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
each
 
had
 
double-digit
 
revenue
 
growth
 
this
 
quarter ,
 
reflecting
 
strong
 
momentum
 
across
 
the
 
business.
 
 
Total
 
Cost
 
of
 
Revenues
 
was
 
$39 billion,
 
up
 
10%.
 
 
 
TAC
 
was
 
$14.7 billion,
 
up
 
10%
 
and
 
Other
 
Cost
 
of
 
Revenues
 
was
 
$24.3 billion,
 
up
 
10%,
 
with
 
the
 
increase
 
primarily
 
driven
 
by
 
content
 
acquisition
 
costs,
 
largely
 
for
 
YouTube,
 
followed
 
by
 
depreciation.
 
 
Total
 
operating
 
expenses
 
increased
 
20%
 
to
 
$26.1 billion.
 
The
 
biggest
 
driver
 
of
 
growth
 
was
 
expenses
 
for
 
legal
 
and
 
other
 
matters,
 
which
 
reflected
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
a
 
$1.4 billion
 
charge
 
related
 
to
 
a
 
settlement
 
in
 
principle
 
of
 
certain
 
legal
 
matters.
 
 
R&D
 
investments
 
increased
 
by
 
16%,
 
primarily
 
driven
 
by
 
increases
 
in
 
compensation
 
and
 
depreciation
 
expenses.
 
 
Sales
 
and
 
Marketing
 
expenses
 
increased
 
5%,
 
primarily
 
reflecting
 
an
 
increase
 
in
 
advertising
 
and
 
promotional
 
expenses.
 
 
Operating
 
income
 
increased
 
14%
 
this
 
quarter
 
to
 
$31.3 billion,
 
and
 
operating
 
margin
 
was
 
32.4%.
 
Operating
 
margin
 
benefited
 
from
 
strong
 
revenue
 
growth
 
and
 
continued
 
efficiencies
 
in
 
our
 
expense
 
base,
 
partially
 
offset
 
by
 
the
 
legal
 
charge
 
I
 
mentioned
 
earlier ,
 
and
 
a
 
significant
 
increase
 
in
 
depreciation
 
expense.

Net
 
income
 
increased

and
 
earnings
 
per

increased
 
22%
 
to
 
$2.31.
 
 
We
 
generated
 
free
 
cash
 
flow
 
of
 
$5.3
 
billion
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
and
 
$66.7 billion
 
for
 
the
 
trailing
 
twelve
 
months.
 
 
Free
 
Cash
 
Flow
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
was
 
affected
 
by
 
a
 
sizable
 
sequential
 
increase
 
in
 
CapEx
 
and
 
cash
 
tax
 
payments
 
as
 
we
 
make
 
federal
 
tax
 
payments
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter
 
for
 
both
 
Q1
 
and
 
Q2.
 
 
We
 
ended
 
the
 
quarter
 
with
 
$95 billion
 
in
 
cash
 
and
 
marketable
 
securities.
 
 
Turning
 
to
 
segment
 
results,
 
Google
 
Services
 
revenues
 
increased
 
12%
 
to
 
$82.5 billion,
 
reflecting
 
strength
 
in
 
Google

and
 
YouTube
 
advertising
 
and
 
subscriptions.
 
 
Google

with
 
the
 
largest

coming
 
from
 
Retail

YouTube
 
advertising
 
revenues
 
increased
 
13%
 
to
 
$9.8 billion,
 
driven
 
by
 
Direct
 
Response
 
advertising,
 
followed
 
by
 
Brand.

revenues
 
increased
 
20%
 
to
 
$11.2 billion,
 
primarily
 
reflecting
 
growth
 
in
 
subscription
 
revenues.
 
This
 
growth
 
was
 
driven
 
by
 
YouTube
 
subscription
 
offerings,
 
followed
 
by
 
Google
 
One,
 
with
 
growth
 
in
 
paid
 
subscriptions
 
being
 
the
 
biggest
 
driver
 
of
 
revenue
 
growth.
 
 
Google
 
Services
 
operating
 
income
 
increased
 
11%
 
to
 
$33.1 billion.
 
Operating
 
margin
 
was
 
flat
 
year-on-year
 
at
 
40.1%,
 
as
 
healthy
 
revenue
 
growth
 
and
 
continued
 
efficiency
 
in
 
our

partially
 
offset
 
by

I
 
mentioned
 
earlier .
 
 
Turning
 
to
 
the
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
segment,
 
which
 
delivered
 
very
 
strong
 
results
 
this
 
quarter .
 
Revenues
 
increased
 
by
 
32%
 
to
 
$13.6 billion
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
reflecting
 
growth
 
in
 
GCP
 
across
 
Core
 
and
 
AI
 
products,
 
at
 
the
 
rate
 
that
 
was
 
much
 
higher
 
than
 
Cloud's
 
overall
 
revenue
 
growth,
 
and
 
growth
 
in
 
Google

driven
 
by
 
an
 
increase
 
in

Google

operating
 
income
 
increased
 
to
 
$2.8 billion,
 
and
 
operating
 
margin
 
increased
 
from
 
11.3%
 
to
 
20.7%.
 
The
 
expansion
 
in
 
Cloud
 
operating
 
margin
 
was
 
driven
 
by
 
strong
 
revenue
 
performance
 
and
 
continued
 
efficiencies
 
in
 
our
 
expense
 
base,
 
partially
 
offset
 
by
 
higher
 
technical
 
infrastructure
 
usage
 
costs,
 
which
 
includes
 
the
 
associated
 
depreciation.
 
 
As
 
we
 
ramp
 
our
 
AI
 
investments,
 
we
 
continue
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
driving
 
improvements
 
in
 
productivity
 
and
 
efficiency
 
to
 
offset
 
growth
 
in
 
technical
 
infrastructure
 
related
 
expenses,
 
particularly
 
from
 
higher
 
depreciation.
 
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
backlog
 
increased
 
18%
 
sequentially
 
in
 
Q2
 
and
 
38%
 
year-over-year ,
 
reaching
 
$106 billion
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
quarter .
 
This
 
growth
 
was
 
driven
 
by
 
strong
 
demand
 
for
 
our
 
products
 
and
 
services
 
from
 
both
 
new
 
and
 
existing
 
customers.
 
 
As
 
Sundar
 
mentioned,
 
we
 
have
 
signed
 
multiple
 
billion-dollar-plus
 
deals
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
 
 
As
 
for
 
Other
 
Bets,
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
revenues
 
were
 
$373 million,
 
and
 
operating
 
loss
 
was
 
$1.2 billion.
 
Within
 
Other
 
Bets,
 
we're
 
allocating
 
more
 
resources
 
to
 
businesses
 
like
 
Waymo,
 
where
 
we
 
see
 
opportunities
 
to
 
create
 
additional
 
value.
 
 
With
 
respect
 
to
 
CapEx
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
our
 
CapEx
 
was
 
$22.4 billion.
 
The
 
vast
 
majority
 
of
 
our
 
CapEx
 
was
 
invested
 
in
 
technical
 
infrastructure,
 
with
 
approximately
 
two-thirds
 
of
 
investments
 
in
 
servers
 
and
 
one-third
 
in
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
networking
 
equipment.
 
 
In
 
Q2,
 
we
 
returned
 
capital
 
to
 
shareholders
 
through
 
repurchases
 
of
 
stock
 
of
 
$13.6 billion
 
and
 
dividend
 
payments
 
of
 
$2.5 billion.
 
 
Turning
 
to
 
our
 
outlook.
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
provide
 
some
 
commentary
 
on
 
several
 
factors
 
that
 
will
 
impact
 
our
 
business
 
performance
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
an
 
updated
 
outlook
 
for
 
full-year
 
CapEx.
 
 
First,
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
revenues,
 
we're
 
pleased
 
with
 
the
 
overall
 
momentum
 
we're
 
seeing
 
across
 
the
 
business.
 
At
 
current
 
spot
 
rates,
 
we
 
could
 
see
 
a
 
tailwind
 
to
 
our
 
revenues
 
in
 
Q3.
 
However ,
 
volatility
 
in
 
exchange
 
rates
 
could
 
affect
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
FX
 
on
 
Q3
 
revenues.
 
 
 
As
 
for
 
our
 
segments,
 
in
 
Google
 
Services,
 
advertising
 
revenues
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2025
 
will
 
be
 
affected
 
by
 
the
 
following:
 
 
12
 
 
The
 
continuing
 
lapping
 
of
 
the
 
strength
 
we
 
experience
 
in
 
the
 
Financial
 
Services
 
vertical
 
throughout
 
2024
 
and
 
year-over-year
 
comparisons
 
will
 
be
 
negatively
 
impacted
 
by
 
the
 
strong
 
spend
 
on
 
U.S.
 
elections
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
2024,
 
particularly
 
on
 
YouTube.
 
 
In
 
Cloud,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned,
 
the
 
demand
 
for
 
our
 
products
 
is
 
high,
 
as
 
evidenced
 
by
 
the
 
continued
 
revenue
 
growth
 
and
 
the
 
Cloud
 
backlog
 
of
 
$106
 
billion.
 
While
 
we
 
have
 
been
 
working
 
hard
 
to
 
increase
 
capacity
 
and
 
have
 
improved
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
server
 
deployments,
 
we
 
expect
 
to
 
remain
 
in
 
a
 
tight
 
demand-supply
 
environment
 
going
 
into
 
2026.
 
 
Moving
 
to
 
investments,
 
given
 
the
 
strong
 
demand
 
for
 
our
 
Cloud
 
products
 
and
 
services,
 
we
 
now
 
expect
 
to
 
invest
 
approximately
 
$85 billion
 
in
 
CapEx
 
in
 
2025,
 
up
 
from
 
a
 
previous
 
estimate
 
of
 
$75 billion.
 
 
Our
 
updated
 
outlook
 
reflects
 
additional
 
investment
 
in
 
servers,
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
delivery
 
of
 
servers
 
and
 
an
 
acceleration
 
in
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
data
 
center
 
construction,
 
primarily
 
to
 
meet
 
Cloud
 
customer
 
demand.
 
 
Looking
 
out
 
to
 
2026,
 
we
 
expect
 
a
 
further
 
increase
 
in
 
CapEx
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
demand
 
we're
 
seeing
 
from
 
customers
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
growth
 
opportunities
 
across
 
the
 
company .
 
 
We
 
will
 
provide
 
more
 
details
 
in
 
the
 
2026
 
CapEx
 
outlook
 
on
 
a
 
future
 
earnings
 
call.
 
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
expenses.
 
First,
 
as
 
I
 
mentioned
 
on
 
our
 
previous
 
earnings
 
call,
 
the
 
significant
 
increase
 
in
 
our
 
investments
 
in
 
CapEx
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
years
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
put
 
pressure
 
on
 
the
 
P&L,
 
primarily
 
in
 
the
 
form
 
of
 
higher
 
depreciation.
 
 
 
In
 
the
 
second
 
quarter ,
 
depreciation
 
increased
 
$1.3 billion
 
year-over-year
 
to
 
$5 billion,
 
reflecting
 
a
 
growth
 
rate
 
of
 
35%.
 
Given
 
the
 
recent
 
increase
 
in
 
CapEx
 
investments,
 
we
 
expect
 
the
 
growth
 
rate
 
in
 
depreciation
 
to
 
accelerate
 
further
 
in
 
Q3.
 
 
Second,
 
as
 
we
 
have
 
previously
 
said,
 
we
 
expect
 
some
 
headcount
 
growth
 
in
 
2025
 
in
 
key
 
investment
 
areas.
 
In
 
the
 
third
 
quarter ,
 
we
 
expect
 
a
 
sequential
 
increase
 
in
 
total
 
headcount
 
additions
 
due
 
in
 
part
 
to
 
the
 
hiring
 
of
 
new
 
graduates.
 
 
Third,
 
Q3
 
will
 
reflect
 
the
 
expense
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
upcoming
 
August
 
launch
 
of
 
the
 
new
 
Pixel
 
family
 
of
 
products.
 
 
In
 
conclusion,
 
as
 
you
 
heard
 
from
 
Sundar
 
and
 
Philipp,
 
we're
 
pleased
 
with
 
the
 
momentum
 
in
 
the
 
business
 
and
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
pace
 
of
 
innovation.
 
Our
 
full-stack
 
approach,
 
which
 
combines
 
AI
 
infrastructure,
 
AI
 
research
 
and
 
AI
 
products
 
and
 
platforms,
 
13
 
 
positions
 
us
 
well
 
to
 
deliver
 
new
 
products
 
and
 
services
 
across
 
the
 
company .
 
 
We're
 
seeing
 
great
 
momentum
 
with
 
our
 
AI
 
efforts
 
as
 
demonstrated
 
by
 
the
 
increase
 
in
 
cumulative
 
tokens
 
processed.
 
 
 
Search
 
revenues
 
are
 
seeing
 
healthy
 
growth
 
with
 
features
 
like
 
AI
 
Overviews,
 
AI
 
Mode,
 
and
 
Lens
 
offering
 
new
 
ways
 
for
 
users
 
to
 
access
 
information.
 
 
Cloud
 
has
 
reached
 
an
 
annual
 
revenue
 
run-rate
 
of
 
more
 
than
 
$50
 
billion
 
and
 
is
 
delivering
 
margin
 
expansion
 
while
 
continuing
 
to
 
invest
 
to
 
meet
 
customer
 
demand.
 
 
 
And
 
YouTube
 
has
 
expanded
 
its
 
addressable
 
market,
 
by
 
building
 
new
 
services
 
like
 
Shorts,
 
which
 
now
 
averages
 
over
 
200 billion
 
daily
 
views.
 
 
We're
 
excited
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
value
 
our
 
products
 
and
 
services
 
are
 
bringing
 
to
 
customers
 
and
 
partners
 
around
 
the
 
globe.
 
 
Now
 
I'll
 
turn
 
the
 
call
 
over
 
to
 
the
 
operator ,
 
and
 
Sundar ,
 
Philipp
 
and
 
I
 
will
 
take
 
your
 
questions.
 
 
Operator:
 
Thank
 
you.
 
As
 
a
 
reminder ,
 
to
 
ask
 
a
 
question,
 
you
 
will
 
need
 
to
 
press
 
*1
 
on
 
your
 
telephone.
 
To
 
prevent
 
any
 
background
 
noise,
 
we
 
ask
 
that
 
you
 
please
 
mute
 
your
 
line
 
once
 
your
 
question
 
has
 
been
 
stated.
 
 
Your
 
first
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Eric
 
Sheridan
 
with
 
Goldman
 
Sachs.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Eric
 
Sheridan
 
(Goldman
 
Sachs):
 
Thank
 
you
 
so
 
much
 
for
 
taking
 
the
 
question.
 
Maybe
 
one
 
for
 
Sundar
 
and
 
one
 
for
 
Philipp.
 
 
Sundar ,
 
when
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
journey
 
you're
 
on
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
the
 
evolution
 
of
 
products
 
and
 
platforms,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
think
 
about,
 
sort
 
of,
 
the
 
implications
 
of
 
changed
 
consumer
 
behavior
 
and
 
how
 
investors
 
should
 
think
 
about
 
that
 
from
 
the
 
volume
 
perspective
 
versus
 
the
 
monetization
 
perspective?
 
Because
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
longstanding
 
dynamics
 
out
 
there
 
about
 
clicks
 
and
 
click
 
monetization
 
that
 
might
 
be
 
very
 
different
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
out
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
three
 
to
 
five
 
years.
 
 
And
 
Philipp,
 
when
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
evolution
 
of
 
YouTube,
 
you
 
made
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
comments
 
about
 
subscription
 
revenue.
 
I'm
 
just
 
curious
 
about
 
how
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
the
 
mix
 
of
 
advertising
 
versus
 
subscription,
 
and
 
what
 
some
 
of
 
your
 
key
 
learnings
 
might
 
have
 
14
 
 
been
 
as
 
the
 
subscription
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
business
 
continues
 
to
 
scale.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Thanks,
 
Eric.
 
Appreciate
 
the
 
question.
 
 
 
I
 
do
 
think
 
looking
 
ahead,
 
based
 
on
 
everything
 
we
 
are
 
seeing,
 
people
 
are
 
excited
 
about
 
AI.
 
They
 
are
 
adopting
 
it
 
well
 
across
 
our
 
products.
 
For
 
me,
 
just
 
seeing
 
multimodality ,
 
how
 
people
 
have
 
modified
 
their
 
behavior
 
to
 
include
 
images,
 
both
 
through
 
Lens
 
and
 
Circle
 
to
 
Search
 
seamlessly
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
interacting
 
with
 
Google,
 
are
 
early
 
indications
 
that
 
people
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
adapting
 
to
 
these
 
moments
 
very,
 
very
 
well.
 
 
I’m
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
your
 
question
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
clicks
 
and
 
click
 
monetization,
 
maybe
 
that's
 
something
 
Philipp
 
can
 
touch
 
on.
 
 
But
 
overall,
 
we
 
expect
 
as
 
we
 
build
 
out
 
our
 
organic
 
experiences,
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
good
 
understanding
 
of
 
how
 
to
 
continue
 
iterating
 
on
 
monetization,
 
so
 
that
 
it
 
will
 
work
 
well
 
with
 
organic
 
experiences.
 
But
 
we
 
will
 
lead
 
with
 
organic
 
experience.
 
So
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
newer
 
surfaces
 
like
 
Gemini
 
app,
 
et
 
cetera,
 
we'll
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
organic
 
experience
 
for
 
the
 
near
 
term.
 
 
But
 
just
 
like
 
we
 
are
 
doing
 
with
 
AI
 
Overviews
 
and
 
with
 
AI
 
Mode
 
over
 
time,
 
we'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
bring
 
very,
 
very
 
good
 
commercial
 
experiences
 
there
 
as
 
well,
 
and
 
we
 
think
 
people
 
will
 
adapt
 
to
 
them
 
as
 
they've
 
always
 
done.
 
 
Maybe
 
Philipp
 
can
 
add
 
more.
 
Philipp?
 
 
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CBO,
 
Google:
 
Yeah,
 
so,
 
your
 
question
 
on
 
YouTube
 
subscriptions
 
versus
 
ads,
 
look,
 
I
 
mean,
 
we
 
love
 
our
 
ads
 
business.
 
We
 
love
 
our
 
subscription
 
business.
 
YouTube
 
subscriptions
 
are
 
increasingly
 
important
 
for
 
YouTube.
 
We'll
 
definitely
 
continue
 
a
 
long-term
 
focus
 
here.
 
 
 
We
 
had
 
strong
 
growth
 
across
 
YouTube
 
subscription
 
products,
 
which
 
includes,
 
just
 
to
 
be
 
clear;
 
YouTube
 
TV,
 
YouTube
 
Music,
 
and
 
Premium.
 
I
 
think
 
one
 
common
 
theme
 
for
 
our
 
subscription
 
services
 
in
 
general
 
is
 
offering
 
viewers
 
more
 
choice
 
here.
 
 
We
 
also
 
have
 
a
 
very
 
deep
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
monetization
 
side
 
here:
 
“Where
 
are
 
we
 
monetizing
 
more
 
with
 
ads?
 
Where
 
can
 
we
 
potentially
 
monetize
 
more
 
with
 
subscriptions?”
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
will
 
continue
 
this
 
as
 
a
 
double-tier
 
strategy
 
actively
 
going
 
forward.

Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Doug
 
Anmuth
 
with
 
JP
 
Morgan.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Doug
 
Anmuth
 
(JPMorgan):
 
Thanks
 
so
 
much
 
for
 
taking
 
the
 
questions.
 
One
 
for
 
Sundar
 
and
 
one
 
for
 
Philipp.
 
 
Sundar ,
 
can
 
you
 
just
 
talk
 
about
 
how
 
you're
 
thinking
 
about
 
your
 
current
 
access
 
to
 
compute?
 
Even
 
as
 
you
 
spend
 
$10 billion
 
more
 
this
 
year
 
in
 
CapEx,
 
you
 
also
 
said
 
that
 
you're
 
still
 
in
 
a
 
tight
 
supply
 
environment.
 
I'm
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
marry
 
those.
 
 
And
 
then,
 
Philipp,
 
perhaps
 
on
 
Search
 
growth,
 
can
 
you
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
paid
 
click
 
and
 
pricing
 
growth,
 
just
 
within
 
the
 
12%
 
Search
 
growth
 
and
 
how
 
we
 
should
 
think
 
about
 
volume
 
versus
 
monetization
 
trends
 
going
 
forward?
 
Thanks.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Doug,
 
thanks.
 
 
 
On
 
the
 
CapEx
 
stuff,
 
obviously ,
 
we
 
are
 
seeing
 
strong
 
momentum
 
across
 
our
 
portfolio,
 
especially
 
in
 
Cloud.
 
You
 
are
 
right,
 
it's
 
a
 
tight
 
supply
 
environment
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
investing
 
more
 
to
 
expand.
 
But
 
there
 
is
 
obviously
 
a
 
time
 
delay
 
between
 
this
 
additional
 
investment
 
will
 
play
 
out
 
in
 
future
 
years.
 
So,
 
that's
 
why
 
both
 
of
 
them
 
are
 
true
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
 
But
 
we
 
are
 
planning
 
ahead
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
investing.
 
But
 
overall,
 
it's
 
exciting
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
traction,
 
particularly
 
in
 
Cloud.
 
I
 
think
 
the
 
comprehensiveness
 
of
 
our
 
AI
 
portfolio;
 
the
 
breadth
 
of
 
our
 
offerings,
 
both
 
providing
 
our
 
models
 
on
 
GPUs
 
and
 
TPUs
 
for
 
our
 
customers,
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
has
 
been
 
really
 
driving
 
demand,
 
and
 
so,
 
we
 
are
 
investing
 
to
 
match
 
up
 
to
 
it.
 
 
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CBO,
 
Google:
 
And
 
on
 
your
 
paid
 
click
 
question,
 
look,
 
to
 
be
 
very
 
clear ,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
said
 
this
 
before,
 
we
 
manage
 
the
 
business
 
to
 
drive
 
great
 
outcomes
 
for
 
our
 
users
 
and
 
an
 
attractive
 
ROI
 
for
 
our
 
advertisers.
 
We
 
actually
 
don't
 
manage
 
to
 
paid
 
clicks
 
and
 
CPC
 
targets.
 
 
 
Some
 
of
 
the
 
product
 
and
 
policy
 
changes
 
we
 
make
 
actually
 
drive
 
better
 
monetization
 
at
 
the
 
expense
 
of
 
paid
 
clicks.
 
You
 
will
 
actually
 
see
 
in
 
the
 
10-Q
 
that
 
paid
 
clicks
 
were
 
up
 
4%
 
year-on-year .
 
But
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
factors
 
affect
 
these
 
metrics
 
from
 
quarter
 
to
 
quarter ,
 
such
 
as,
 
a
 
few
 
examples;
 
advertiser
 
spending,
 
product
 
changes,
 
policy
 
changes,
 
user
 
engagement,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
 
So,
 
it's
 
really
 
important
 
when
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
paid
 
clicks
 
and
 
CPCs
 
to
 
avoid
 
drawing
 
overly
 
16
 
 
broad
 
conclusions
 
solely
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
metrics.
 
 
 
Doug
 
Anmuth
 
(JPMorgan):
 
Thank
 
you
 
both.
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Brian
 
Nowak
 
with
 
Morgan
 
Stanley .
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Brian
 
Nowak
 
(Morgan
 
Stanley):
 
Thanks
 
for
 
taking
 
my
 
questions.
 
I
 
have
 
two.
 
 
The
 
first
 
one,
 
Sundar ,
 
there's
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
discussion
 
about
 
agentic
 
search
 
for
 
commercial
 
activities
 
and
 
agents
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
broadly
 
deployed.
 
Maybe,
 
can
 
you
 
just,
 
from
 
a
 
technology
 
perspective,
 
when
 
you
 
sit
 
down
 
with
 
the
 
engineering
 
teams
 
working
 
on
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
new
 
agentic
 
capabilities
 
that
 
could
 
come,
 
what
 
are
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
predominant
 
technological
 
hurdles
 
that
 
you
 
think
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
cleared
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
launch
 
scalable
 
agents
 
for
 
commercial
 
queries,
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
one.
 
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
one,
 
I
 
think
 
in
 
the
 
past,
 
you've
 
updated
 
us
 
on
 
stats
 
on
 
sources
 
of
 
internal
 
efficiency
 
you've
 
seen
 
from
 
gen
 
AI-enabled
 
capabilities.
 
Any
 
updates
 
there?
 
And
 
any
 
sort
 
of
 
learnings
 
on
 
friction
 
points
 
that
 
also
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
overcome
 
for
 
some
 
of
 
these
 
internal
 
tools
 
with
 
gen
 
AI?
 
Thanks.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Thanks,
 
Brian.
 
Let
 
me
 
start
 
with
 
the
 
first
 
one
 
on
 
agentic
 
capabilities.
 
 
 
Look,
 
overall,
 
we
 
are
 
definitely ,
 
in
 
many
 
ways,
 
when
 
we
 
built
 
our
 
series
 
of
 
2.5
 
models,
 
particularly
 
with
 
Pro,
 
et
 
cetera,
 
it's
 
the
 
direction
 
where
 
we
 
are
 
investing
 
the
 
most.
 
There's
 
definitely
 
exciting
 
progress,
 
including
 
in
 
the
 
models
 
we
 
haven't
 
fully
 
released
 
yet.
 
 
The
 
main
 
gaps
 
we
 
are
 
all
 
trying
 
to
 
do
 
is;
 
you're
 
obviously
 
chaining
 
a
 
sequence
 
of
 
events,
 
and
 
so,
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
reliably;
 
the
 
latency
 
compounds,
 
the
 
cost
 
compounds.
 
And
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
reliably
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
for
 
the
 
users.
 
All
 
of
 
this
 
comes
 
together .
 
In
 
each
 
of
 
this,
 
we
 
are
 
making
 
progress
 
and
 
it
 
all
 
needs
 
to
 
kind
 
of
 
hang
 
together .
 
 
 
The
 
good
 
news
 
is
 
we
 
are
 
making
 
robust
 
progress.
 
We
 
think
 
we
 
are
 
at
 
the
 
frontier
 
there.
 
 
In
 
all
 
of
 
these
 
areas,
 
when
 
you
 
look
 
back
 
in
 
a
 
12-month
 
basis,
 
you
 
end
 
up
 
making
 
the
 
models
 
much
 
more
 
efficient
 
for
 
any
 
given
 
capabilities.
 
So,
 
the
 
forward-looking
 
trajectory ,
 
I
 
think,
 
will
 
really
 
unlock
 
these
 
agentic
 
experiences.
 
We
 
see
 
the
 
potential
 
of
 
17
 
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
them,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
a
 
bit
 
slow
 
and
 
costly
 
and
 
take
 
time,
 
and
 
sometimes
 
are
 
brittle,
 
right?
 
But
 
they're
 
making
 
progress
 
on
 
all
 
of
 
that.
 
 
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
what
 
we'll
 
really
 
unlock,
 
and
 
I
 
expect
 
2026
 
to
 
be
 
the
 
year
 
in
 
which
 
people
 
kind
 
of
 
use
 
agentic
 
experiences
 
more
 
broadly .
 
And
 
so,
 
it's
 
an
 
exciting
 
opportunity
 
ahead.
 
 
On
 
the
 
second
 
part,
 
I
 
think
 
when
 
you
 
say
 
a
 
source
 
of
 
internalization,
 
I
 
presume
 
you
 
are
 
talking
 
about
 
how
 
we
 
are
 
using
 
all
 
of
 
this
 
internally .
 
 
 
Again,
 
given
 
you
 
asked
 
the
 
question
 
about
 
agents,
 
we
 
are
 
now
 
beginning
 
to
 
roll
 
out
 
agentic
 
coding
 
journeys
 
for
 
our
 
software
 
engineers
 
within
 
the
 
company .
 
It's
 
been
 
exciting
 
to
 
see,
 
just
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
months,
 
particularly
 
over
 
the
 
last
 
few
 
weeks,
 
people
 
are
 
definitely
 
doing
 
more
 
agentic
 
workflows
 
and
 
software
 
engineering
 
as
 
well,
 
internally .
 
 
 
That's
 
a
 
good
 
example
 
of
 
how
 
the
 
same
 
experiences
 
a
 
few
 
months
 
ago
 
had
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
friction
 
points;
 
but
 
we
 
are
 
overcoming
 
it
 
and
 
people
 
are
 
beginning
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
internally
 
on
 
the
 
coding
 
side,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
in
 
certain
 
other
 
areas
 
of
 
the
 
company
 
as
 
well.
 
 
So,
 
exciting
 
progress.
 
I
 
expect
 
it
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
active
 
area
 
where
 
we
 
will
 
roll
 
out
 
journeys
 
for
 
our
 
users
 
as
 
well,
 
so
 
I
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
it.
 
 
 
Brian
 
Nowak
 
(Morgan
 
Stanley):
 
Thanks,
 
Sundar .
 
That's
 
great.
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Michael
 
Nathanson
 
with
 
MoffettNathanson.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Michael
 
Nathanson
 
(MoffettNathanson):
 
Thanks.
 
Sundar ,
 
I
 
have
 
two
 
for
 
you.
 
 
 
At
 
I/O,
 
you
 
announced
 
a
 
partnership
 
with
 
Warby
 
Parker
 
to
 
develop
 
glasses.
 
So,
 
I
 
wonder
 
if
 
you'd
 
share
 
your
 
view
 
of
 
how
 
important
 
a
 
cycle
 
of
 
new
 
devices
 
will
 
be
 
to
 
further
 
scale
 
AI?
 
And
 
do
 
you
 
envision
 
a
 
world
 
in
 
which
 
they're
 
more
 
personal
 
and
 
more
 
central
 
to
 
our
 
consumer
 
experience?
 
That's
 
one.
 
 
 
Secondly ,
 
how
 
does
 
Google
 
Search
 
with
 
AI
 
Mode
 
usage
 
differ
 
versus
 
Gemini
 
standalone
 
app?
 
I'm
 
wondering,
 
do
 
you
 
see
 
any
 
differences
 
in
 
usage
 
or
 
the
 
types
 
of
 
consumers
 
who
 
go
 
to
 
the
 
app
 
versus
 
those
 
who
 
go
 
to
 
traditional
 
search
 
with
 
AI?
 
Thanks.
 
 
 
18
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Thanks,
 
Michael.
 
 
On
 
the
 
first
 
thing,
 
I
 
think
 
any
 
time
 
I/O
 
changes,
 
you
 
can
 
drive
 
new
 
experiences,
 
including
 
on
 
hardware
 
experiences,
 
too.
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
AI
 
will
 
particularly
 
enable,
 
you've
 
long
 
heard
 
the
 
promise
 
of
 
glasses
 
and
 
other
 
form
 
factors,
 
I
 
think
 
AI
 
will
 
spur
 
a
 
whole
 
new
 
wave
 
of
 
innovation
 
there.
 
 
 
We
 
are
 
super
 
excited
 
about
 
our
 
investment
 
in
 
glasses,
 
and
 
I've
 
found
 
the
 
experiences
 
have
 
taken
 
a
 
dramatic
 
step
 
up
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
last
 
iteration.
 
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
it'll
 
be
 
an
 
exciting
 
new
 
emerging
 
category ,
 
but
 
I
 
still
 
expect
 
phones
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
experience
 
for
 
the
 
next
 
two
 
to
 
three
 
years,
 
at
 
least.
 
And
 
so,
 
I
 
still
 
think
 
that
 
it’s
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
phones
 
[that]
 
will
 
continue
 
to
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
consumer
 
experience.
 
But
 
we
 
are
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
emerging
 
categories
 
as
 
well.
 
 
On
 
your
 
second
 
question,
 
on
 
AI
 
Mode
 
versus
 
Gemini
 
standalone
 
app,
 
broadly ,
 
there
 
are
 
some
 
use
 
cases
 
where
 
you
 
can
 
get
 
a
 
great
 
experience
 
in
 
both
 
places,
 
but
 
there
 
are
 
use
 
cases
 
which
 
are
 
very
 
specific.
 
I
 
think
 
where
 
the
 
queries
 
are
 
information-oriented,
 
but
 
people
 
really
 
want
 
to
 
rely
 
on
 
the
 
information,
 
but
 
have
 
the
 
full
 
power
 
of
 
AI,
 
I
 
think
 
AI
 
Mode
 
really
 
shines
 
in
 
that.
 
You
 
can
 
go
 
there,
 
and
 
you
 
know
 
it's
 
backed
 
up,
 
the
 
Gemini
 
models
 
are
 
using
 
Search
 
deeply
 
as
 
a
 
tool,
 
so
 
it's
 
all
 
grounded
 
in
 
that
 
Search
 
experience,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
users
 
are
 
responding
 
very
 
positively
 
to
 
it.
 
 
Whereas,
 
in
 
the
 
Gemini
 
standalone
 
app,
 
you
 
see
 
everything
 
from;
 
people
 
can
 
have
 
a
 
long
 
conversation
 
on
 
chat,
 
just
 
trying
 
to
 
pass
 
time
 
in
 
the
 
Gemini
 
app.
 
You've
 
seen
 
early
 
cases
 
where
 
people
 
may
 
get
 
into
 
a
 
therapy-like
 
experience.
 
 
 
So,
 
these
 
are
 
all
 
emerging
 
experiences
 
of
 
what
 
people
 
do,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
this
 
is
 
why
 
I'm
 
glad
 
we
 
have
 
both
 
surfaces
 
and
 
we
 
can
 
innovate
 
in
 
both
 
of
 
these
 
areas.
 
 
Of
 
course,
 
there
 
will
 
be
 
areas
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
commonly
 
served
 
by
 
both
 
applications,
 
and
 
over
 
time,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
can
 
make
 
the
 
experience
 
more
 
seamless
 
for
 
our
 
users.

Thanks,
 
Sundar .
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Mark
 
Shmulik
 
with
 
Bernstein.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Mark
 
Shmulik
 
(Bernstein):
 
Thanks
 
for
 
taking
 
the
 
question.
 
Sundar ,
 
it
 
seems
 
there's
 
almost
 
like
 
a
 
daily
 
news
 
report
 
about
 
the
 
AI
 
talent
 
war
 
and
 
high-profile
 
folks
 
moving
 
19
 
 
around.
 
Would
 
just
 
kind
 
of
 
like
 
your
 
perspective
 
on
 
how
 
you
 
think
 
Google
 
has
 
been
 
doing
 
both
 
at
 
attracting
 
and
 
retaining
 
key
 
AI
 
talent?
 
 
Anat,
 
along
 
the
 
similar
 
lines,
 
how
 
do
 
we
 
think
 
about
 
AI-related
 
resourcing
 
costs
 
alongside
 
a
 
step
 
up
 
in
 
capital
 
investments
 
required
 
to
 
go
 
build
 
for
 
AI?
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Mark,
 
on
 
the
 
first
 
question,
 
look,
 
I
 
think
 
we've
 
gone
 
through
 
these
 
moments
 
before.
 
We
 
have
 
obviously
 
always
 
deeply
 
invested
 
in
 
talent,
 
including
 
in
 
AI
 
talent,
 
for
 
well
 
over
 
a
 
decade
 
now.
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
have
 
an
 
extraordinary
 
both
 
breadth
 
and
 
depth
 
of
 
the
 
talent.
 
 
In
 
my
 
experience,
 
the
 
top
 
people
 
look
 
for
 
a
 
combination
 
of;
 
they
 
want
 
to
 
really
 
be
 
at
 
the
 
frontier
 
driving
 
progress,
 
and
 
so
 
the
 
mission
 
and
 
how
 
state-of-the-art
 
your
 
work
 
is
 
matters,
 
so
 
that's
 
super
 
important
 
to
 
them,
 
access
 
to
 
compute
 
resources,
 
and
 
access
 
to
 
your
 
peers,
 
working
 
with
 
the
 
best
 
people
 
in
 
the
 
industry .
 
 
 
It's
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
and
 
using
 
it
 
to
 
drive
 
impact,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
are
 
pretty
 
competitive
 
on
 
all
 
those
 
fronts.
 
Through
 
this
 
moment,
 
I
 
look
 
at
 
both
 
our
 
retention
 
metrics
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
new
 
talent
 
coming
 
in,
 
and
 
both
 
are
 
healthy .
 
I
 
do
 
know
 
individual
 
cases
 
can
 
make
 
headlines.
 
But
 
when
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
numbers
 
deeply ,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
are
 
doing
 
very
 
well
 
through
 
this
 
moment.
 
 
We'll
 
continue
 
investing
 
in
 
the
 
people
 
and
 
the
 
talent
 
and
 
the
 
compute
 
needed
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
we
 
are
 
set
 
up
 
well
 
for
 
the
 
opportunity
 
ahead.
 
 
And
 
maybe
 
I'll
 
pass
 
it
 
on
 
to
 
Anat.
 
 
 
Anat
 
Ashkenazi,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CFO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Yeah,
 
on
 
the
 
question
 
on
 
how
 
we
 
integrate
 
this
 
into
 
our
 
overall
 
cost
 
structure.
 
And
 
I've
 
mentioned
 
it
 
before,
 
the
 
benefit
 
of
 
having
 
the
 
full
 
stack
 
includes
 
research,
 
which
 
is
 
our
 
people,
 
and
 
one
 
of
 
our
 
most
 
critical
 
resources.
 
So,
 
we
 
make
 
sure
 
that
 
we
 
invest
 
appropriately
 
to
 
have
 
the
 
best
 
and
 
brightest
 
minds
 
in
 
the
 
industry
 
sitting
 
here
 
at
 
Google
 
and
 
advancing
 
our
 
innovation
 
to
 
customers.
 
 
It
 
is
 
part
 
of
 
what
 
you're
 
seeing
 
now
 
in
 
our
 
operating
 
expense
 
line
 
across
 
the
 
organization,
 
but
 
we're
 
also
 
working
 
hard
 
to
 
offset,
 
not
 
just
 
growth
 
and
 
investment
 
across
 
the
 
business,
 
but
 
also
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
we
 
can
 
allocate
 
resources
 
appropriately .
 
 
So,
 
Sundar
 
mentioned
 
earlier
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
AI
 
tools
 
within
 
the
 
company .
 
So
 
that's
 
another
 
area
 
where
 
we
 
can
 
drive
 
efficiency
 
across
 
the
 
businesses,
 
is
 
to
 
use
 
these
 
tools
 
20
 
 
internally
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
how
 
we
 
run
 
the
 
organization.
 
 
And
 
then
 
we're
 
continuing
 
on
 
the
 
same
 
efforts
 
that
 
I've
 
talked
 
about
 
before
 
with
 
regards
 
to
 
running
 
the
 
company
 
with
 
a
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
discipline,
 
execution,
 
and
 
driving
 
efficiency
 
across
 
the
 
business.
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Ross
 
Sandler
 
with
 
Barclays.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Ross
 
Sandler
 
(Barclays):
 
Great.
 
If
 
I
 
can
 
ask
 
two,
 
that
 
would
 
be
 
great.
 
 
So,
 
the
 
first
 
one
 
is
 
on
 
Search
 
click-through
 
rates
 
as
 
a
 
driver
 
of
 
monetization.
 
So,
 
you
 
guys
 
have
 
done
 
a
 
great
 
job
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
decade
 
of
 
driving
 
better
 
ad
 
relevancy
 
and
 
higher
 
click-through
 
rates
 
in
 
Search.
 
Just
 
curious,
 
as
 
we
 
look
 
forward
 
and
 
we
 
see
 
lower
 
ad
 
impressions
 
per
 
SERP
 
and
 
all
 
these
 
things
 
that
 
are
 
changing
 
with
 
AI
 
Overviews
 
and
 
different
 
AI
 
search
 
formats,
 
how
 
do
 
you
 
feel
 
about
 
your
 
ability
 
to
 
drive
 
CTR
 
going
 
forward?
 
 
Then
 
the
 
second
 
question
 
is:
 
it
 
looks
 
like
 
you're
 
now
 
working
 
with
 
OpenAI
 
for
 
some
 
aspect
 
of
 
cloud
 
infrastructure.
 
Just
 
curious
 
how
 
that
 
relationship
 
might
 
expand
 
in
 
the
 
future?
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CBO,
 
Google:
 
I
 
can
 
take
 
the
 
first
 
one.
 
 
 
Look,
 
specifically
 
referring
 
to
 
the
 
AI
 
Overviews,
 
if
 
I
 
understood
 
your
 
question
 
correctly ,
 
Sundar
 
mentioned
 
it.
 
They
 
continue
 
to
 
drive
 
higher
 
satisfaction.
 
They
 
continue
 
to
 
drive
 
higher
 
Search
 
usage.
 
They're
 
scaling
 
up
 
very
 
nicely ,
 
and
 
they're
 
actually
 
working
 
for
 
our
 
entire
 
user
 
base
 
now,
 
scaled
 
to
 
over
 
two
 
billion
 
users
 
in
 
over
 
200
 
countries.
 
So,
 
very
 
happy
 
with
 
this
 
development.
 
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
specifically
 
to
 
the
 
monetization
 
of
 
it,
 
we
 
talked
 
about
 
it
 
before.
 
We
 
see
 
monetization
 
at
 
approximately
 
the
 
same
 
rate,
 
which
 
gives
 
us
 
actually
 
a
 
really
 
strong
 
base
 
on
 
which
 
we
 
can
 
then
 
innovate
 
and
 
drive
 
actually
 
more
 
innovative
 
and
 
new
 
and
 
next
 
generation
 
ad
 
formats.
 
That's
 
how
 
we
 
look
 
at
 
it
 
at
 
this
 
moment
 
in
 
time.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
On
 
the
 
second
 
part,
 
with
 
respect
 
to
 
OpenAI,
 
look,
 
we
 
are
 
very
 
excited
 
to
 
be
 
partnering
 
with
 
them
 
on
 
Google
 
Cloud.
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
is
 
an
 
open
 
platform,
 
and
 
we
 
have
 
a
 
strong
 
history
 
of
 
supporting
 
great
 
companies;
 
start-ups,
 
AI
 
labs,
 
et
 
cetera.
 
So,
 
super
 
excited
 
about
 
our
 
partnership
 
there
 
on
 
the
 
cloud
 
side.
 
We
 
look
 
forward
 
to
 
investing
 
more
 
in
 
that
 
relationship
 
and
 
growing
 
there.
 
 
21
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Mark
 
Mahaney
 
with
 
Evercore.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Mark
 
Mahaney
 
(Evercore):
 
Ok,
 
two
 
questions,
 
please.
 
First,
 
could
 
you
 
just
 
describe,
 
maybe
 
Philipp,
 
what
 
you
 
see
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
the
 
ad
 
environment,
 
maybe
 
for
 
the
 
back
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year,
 
maybe
 
versus
 
last
 
year?
 
Does
 
it
 
seem
 
as
 
certain
 
or
 
as
 
uncertain
 
as
 
it
 
was
 
last
 
year?
 
The
 
results
 
seem
 
pretty
 
strong.
 
Are
 
there
 
any
 
unusual
 
concerns
 
you
 
have
 
for
 
the
 
back
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year?
 
 
And
 
then,
 
Sundar ,
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
ask
 
you
 
again
 
about
 
the
 
two-surfaces
 
approach
 
to
 
search.
 
You
 
must
 
have
 
some
 
internal
 
metrics
 
that
 
tell
 
you
 
that
 
that's
 
the
 
optimal
 
way
 
for
 
you
 
to
 
approach
 
the
 
market.
 
But
 
I'm
 
sure
 
there's
 
a
 
counterargument
 
that
 
just
 
having
 
that
 
unified
 
search
 
and
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
discern
 
the
 
intent
 
of
 
the
 
search,
 
whether
 
it's
 
pure
 
information
 
or
 
commercial,
 
just
 
from
 
the
 
query ,
 
that
 
that
 
could
 
give
 
you
 
a
 
material
 
advantage
 
over
 
other
 
offerings
 
in
 
the
 
market.
 
 
Just
 
talk
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
about
 
what
 
metrics
 
you've
 
seen
 
that
 
make
 
the
 
two-surface
 
solution
 
seem
 
to
 
be
 
optimal.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Philipp
 
Schindler ,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CBO,
 
Google:
 
So,
 
let
 
me
 
start.
 
 
 
Look,
 
we
 
said
 
our
 
Ads
 
business
 
performed
 
strongly
 
in
 
Q2.
 
Give
 
you
 
maybe
 
some
 
vertical
 
color
 
of
 
it.
 
In
 
Q2,
 
Search
 
and
 
Other
 
performance
 
was
 
led
 
by
 
growth
 
across
 
all
 
verticals.
 
We
 
mentioned
 
the
 
largest
 
contributions
 
from
 
Retail
 
and
 
Financial
 
Services,
 
which
 
was
 
probably
 
due
 
actually
 
to
 
strength
 
in
 
Insurance.
 
We
 
saw
 
Healthcare
 
as
 
a
 
sizable
 
contributor
 
to
 
growth
 
as
 
well.
 
 
Look,
 
we're
 
only
 
a
 
few
 
weeks
 
into
 
Q3,
 
so
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
really
 
too
 
early
 
to
 
comment
 
on
 
anything
 
happening
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
half
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Mark,
 
on
 
the
 
second
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
question,
 
look,
 
I
 
think
 
between
 
these
 
two
 
surfaces
 
you're
 
pretty
 
much
 
covering
 
the
 
entire
 
breadth
 
and
 
depth
 
of
 
what
 
humanity
 
can
 
possibly
 
do.
 
So
 
I
 
think
 
there's
 
plenty
 
for
 
two
 
surfaces
 
to
 
tackle
 
at
 
this
 
moment.
 
 
Obviously ,
 
you
 
are
 
right.
 
Search
 
is
 
more
 
information-focused,
 
and
 
we
 
think
 
of
 
the
 
Gemini
 
app
 
as
 
more
 
your
 
assistant;
 
more
 
personal,
 
proactive,
 
and
 
powerful
 
assistant
 
for
 
every
 
aspect
 
of
 
your
 
daily
 
life.
 
And
 
so,
 
you
 
can
 
imagine
 
wanting
 
to
 
code
 
deeply
 
or
 
create
 
a
 
long
 
video,
 
et
 
cetera.
 
Those
 
things
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
the
 
Gemini
 
app
 
today ,
 
22
 
 
better .
 
 
Over
 
time,
 
like
 
we've
 
always
 
done,
 
we've
 
gone
 
through
 
these
 
evolutions
 
before,
 
like
 
as
 
you
 
point
 
out.
 
We
 
can
 
understand
 
user
 
intent
 
better
 
and
 
abstract
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
complexity
 
for
 
our
 
users.
 
At
 
one
 
point,
 
people
 
used
 
to
 
query
 
separately
 
for
 
text,
 
differently
 
from
 
images,
 
differently
 
from
 
videos,
 
et
 
cetera,
 
and
 
we
 
kind
 
of
 
made
 
it
 
all
 
seamless
 
with
 
universal
 
search.
 
 
So,
 
we
 
have
 
the
 
experience
 
of
 
being
 
able
 
to
 
bring
 
together
 
experiences
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
makes
 
sense
 
for
 
our
 
users
 
and
 
do
 
the
 
heavy
 
lifting
 
for
 
them.
 
 
But
 
I
 
think
 
when
 
you're
 
in
 
this
 
early
 
stage
 
of
 
new,
 
emerging
 
paradigms,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
want
 
to
 
make
 
sure
 
we
 
can
 
meet
 
them
 
with
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
expecting
 
today ,
 
and
 
over
 
time,
 
I
 
think
 
it
 
will
 
give
 
us
 
an
 
opportunity
 
to
 
serve
 
them
 
better .
 
So,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
how
 
we
 
are
 
thinking
 
about
 
it.

(Evercore):
 
Okay ,
 
thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Our
 
next
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Ken
 
Gawrelski
 
with
 
Wells
 
Fargo.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Ken
 
Gawrelski
 
(Wells
 
Fargo):
 
Thank
 
you
 
very
 
much.
 
Two,
 
if
 
I
 
may,
 
please.
 
 
The
 
first,
 
on
 
Cloud.
 
I'm
 
just
 
hoping
 
maybe
 
you
 
could
 
clarify
 
your
 
back-half
 
outlook.
 
Given
 
last
 
quarter
 
you
 
talked
 
about
 
some
 
supply
 
constraints
 
that
 
would
 
ease
 
towards
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
2025,
 
but
 
yet
 
you
 
put
 
up
 
a
 
really
 
nice
 
acceleration
 
in
 
Q2.
 
Now,
 
you're
 
talking
 
about
 
some
 
supply
 
constraints
 
easing
 
into
 
'26.
 
If
 
you
 
could
 
just
 
clarify
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
on
 
the
 
back-half
 
outlook
 
for
 
Cloud,
 
given
 
the
 
strong
 
results
 
in
 
Q2.
 
 
And
 
the
 
second
 
is
 
a
 
bigger
 
picture
 
question,
 
which
 
is:
 
agentic
 
experience,
 
does
 
it
 
democratize
 
the
 
web
 
like
 
Search
 
did
 
two
 
decades
 
ago,
 
enabling
 
discovery
 
in
 
the
 
long
 
tail?
 
Or
 
does
 
it
 
lead
 
to
 
more
 
concentration
 
with
 
a
 
smaller
 
group
 
of
 
vertical
 
winners?
 
Would
 
love
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
could
 
opine
 
on
 
that.
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Anat
 
Ashkenazi,
 
SVP
 
and
 
CFO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Okay .
 
On
 
your
 
first
 
question
 
on
 
the
 
Cloud
 
second-half
 
outlook,
 
and
 
the
 
comments
 
I
 
previously
 
made
 
with
 
regards
 
to
 
where
 
we're
 
going
 
to
 
see
 
the
 
capacity
 
increase.
 
So,
 
obviously ,
 
we're
 
working
 
hard
 
to
 
bring
 
more
 
capacity
 
online,
 
which
 
means
 
data
 
centers
 
and
 
servers
 
that
 
are
 
coming
 
online,
 
and
 
we
 
see
 
more
 
of
 
an
 
increase
 
towards
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
 
 
23
 
 
But
 
we're
 
increasing
 
capacity
 
with
 
every
 
quarter
 
that
 
goes
 
by
 
as
 
you
 
can
 
see,
 
with
 
the
 
growth
 
rates
 
we've
 
had,
 
both
 
this
 
quarter
 
and
 
in
 
the
 
previous
 
quarter .
 
 
 
As
 
Sundar
 
mentioned
 
earlier ,
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
investment
 
that's
 
a
 
light
 
switch.
 
It
 
takes
 
time
 
to
 
make
 
this
 
investment.
 
So
 
what
 
you're
 
seeing
 
now
 
is
 
investments
 
we
 
made
 
some
 
time
 
ago
 
that's
 
now
 
translating
 
to
 
additional
 
capacity
 
coming
 
online,
 
but
 
more
 
of
 
that
 
towards
 
the
 
back
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
 
I
 
will
 
say
 
it's
 
important
 
as
 
you
 
think
 
about
 
Cloud
 
growth
 
not
 
to
 
think
 
about
 
this
 
in
 
a
 
linear
 
fashion,
 
because
 
the
 
quarter-on-quarter
 
growth
 
rates
 
could
 
depend
 
on
 
the
 
timing
 
of
 
capacity
 
delivery
 
and
 
when
 
that
 
comes
 
online,
 
so
 
that
 
could
 
move
 
a
 
little
 
bit
 
from
 
quarter
 
to
 
quarter .
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Look
 
on
 
agentic
 
experience,
 
look,
 
I
 
think
 
there
 
was
 
an
 
earlier
 
question
 
on
 
the
 
technology
 
aspects
 
of
 
it
 
and
 
how
 
we
 
are
 
making
 
progress.
 
Obviously ,
 
there
 
is
 
the
 
value
 
proposition
 
for
 
all
 
the
 
players
 
involved,
 
and
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
equally
 
important
 
thing
 
to
 
create
 
the
 
unlock
 
here.
 
 
And
 
I
 
do
 
think
 
over
 
time
 
users
 
will,
 
it's
 
clear
 
to
 
me
 
as
 
you
 
make
 
progress
 
on
 
the
 
agentic
 
experience,
 
it's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
a
 
much
 
better
 
experience
 
for
 
users.
 
 
 
And
 
so,
 
you
 
will
 
find
 
savvier
 
players
 
leaning
 
into
 
these
 
experiences,
 
and
 
that
 
will
 
help
 
them
 
grow
 
and
 
meet
 
this
 
moment.
 
And
 
so,
 
I
 
do
 
think
 
it's
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
some
 
of
 
the
 
players.
 
 
And
 
so,
 
you
 
are
 
right,
 
just
 
like
 
in
 
the
 
early
 
days
 
of
 
the
 
Web,
 
there
 
are
 
aspects
 
about
 
it
 
which
 
will
 
expand
 
access,
 
grow
 
the
 
use
 
cases,
 
et
 
cetera.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
that
 
elements
 
are
 
there.
 
 
But
 
I
 
do
 
think
 
it's
 
important,
 
it's
 
not
 
just
 
a
 
technology
 
play,
 
but
 
we
 
have
 
to
 
solve
 
the
 
business
 
models
 
for
 
the
 
varying
 
players
 
involved.
 
And
 
so,
 
I
 
think
 
that's
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
an
 
important
 
part
 
of
 
this
 
evolution
 
as
 
well.
 
 
 
Ken
 
Gawrelski
 
(Wells
 
Fargo):
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Operator:
 
And
 
our
 
last
 
question
 
comes
 
from
 
Justin
 
Post
 
with
 
BAML.
 
Your
 
line
 
is
 
now
 
open.
 
 
 
Justin
 
Post
 
(BAML):
  
Thank
 
you.
 
A
 
couple
 
for
 
Sundar .
 
 
24
 
 
First,
 
it
 
looks
 
like
 
the
 
subscription
 
businesses
 
are
 
all
 
tracking
 
well,
 
and
 
certainly
 
Gemini
 
2.5
 
has
 
got
 
some
 
good
 
reviews.
 
How
 
are
 
you
 
doing
 
with
 
Gemini
 
subscriptions?
 
I
 
know
 
it's
 
a
 
focus
 
area
 
for
 
the
 
company .
 
Anything
 
you
 
can
 
do
 
to
 
accelerate
 
the
 
consumer
 
subscriptions
 
of
 
Gemini
 
within
 
Google
 
One?
 
 
 
And
 
then
 
secondly ,
 
just
 
on
 
the
 
course
 
change
 
of
 
CapEx,
 
obviously
 
a
 
bigger
 
increase,
 
which
 
appears
 
to
 
be
 
because
 
of
 
Cloud
 
demand.
 
But
 
just
 
your
 
comments
 
on
 
Cloud
 
ROI,
 
I’m
 
sorry ,
 
CapEx
 
ROI,
 
what
 
gives
 
you
 
confidence
 
that
 
you're
 
going
 
to
 
get
 
good
 
returns
 
on
 
that
 
spend?
 
Thank
 
you.
 
 
 
Sundar
 
Pichai,
 
CEO,
 
Alphabet
 
and
 
Google:
 
Great.
 
Look,
 
on
 
the
 
first
 
thing,
 
on
 
subscriptions,
 
we
 
have
 
definitely ,
 
Google
 
One
 
has
 
been
 
an
 
attractive
 
value
 
proposition
 
powered
 
by
 
storage,
 
but
 
now
 
our
 
AI
 
plans,
 
including
 
both
 
Pro
 
and
 
Ultra,
 
and
 
particularly
 
with
 
the
 
2.5
 
series
 
of
 
models,
 
we
 
have
 
definitely
 
seen
 
accelerated
 
traction.
 
So,
 
it
 
was
 
a
 
very
 
healthy
 
quarter .
 
And
 
so,
 
we
 
are
 
definitely
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
opportunities
 
ahead.
 
 
And
 
you
 
will
 
find
 
through
 
this
 
moment,
 
I
 
think
 
we'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
drive
 
growth
 
in
 
that
 
area,
 
based
 
on
 
our
 
AI
 
offerings.
 
And
 
so,
 
it's
 
definitely
 
an
 
area
 
we
 
are
 
both
 
excited
 
by
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
actually
 
seeing
 
traction,
 
particularly
 
in
 
the
 
last
 
quarter ,
 
ever
 
since
 
we
 
introduced
 
2.5
 
Pro.
 
So,
 
we
 
are
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
trajectory
 
there.
 
 
On
 
the
 
CapEx,
 
on
 
the
 
Cloud
 
side,
 
look,
 
I
 
think
 
we
 
are
 
definitely
 
investing
 
because
 
we
 
are
 
delivering
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
value
 
through
 
our
 
cloud
 
offerings.
 
And
 
I
 
think
 
it's
 
important
 
to
 
understand,
 
as
 
we
 
build
 
more
 
and
 
more
 
of
 
an
 
install
 
base
 
with
 
Google
 
Cloud;
 
we
 
have
 
very
 
high
 
customer
 
satisfaction,
 
our
 
churn
 
rates
 
are
 
very
 
low,
 
and
 
we
 
are
 
much
 
more
 
efficient
 
in
 
the
 
investments
 
needed
 
to
 
grow
 
those
 
lines
 
of
 
businesses.
 
 
 
So,
 
you're
 
seeing
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
play
 
out
 
in
 
our
 
margin
 
trajectory ,
 
particularly
 
if
 
you
 
look
 
at
 
it
 
annually ,
 
sequentially ,
 
over
 
the
 
past
 
few
 
years.
 
 
And
 
so,
 
all
 
of
 
that
 
gives
 
us
 
confidence
 
as
 
we
 
are
 
investing
 
in
 
this,
 
we'll
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
have
 
a
 
healthy
 
ROI
 
on
 
our
 
investments.
 
And
 
particularly
 
in
 
this
 
AI
 
moment,
 
there's
 
definitely ,
 
the
 
value
 
we
 
are
 
delivering
 
to
 
the
 
customers
 
is
 
also
 
growing
 
pretty
 
significantly
 
on
 
a
 
forward-looking
 
basis.
 
 
And
 
so,
 
I
 
think
  
all
 
of
 
that
 
will
 
help
 
us
 
do
 
well
 
here.
 
 
 
Operator:
 
Thank
 
you.
