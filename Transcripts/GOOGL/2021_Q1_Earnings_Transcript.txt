Alphabet Q1 2021 Earnings Call
April 27, 2021
Candice (Operator):
Welcome everyone and thank you
for standing by for the Alphabet first
quarter 2021 earnings conference call. At this time,
all participants are in a listen-only mode.
After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a
question-and-answer session. To ask a
question during the session, you will need to press
star one on your telephone. If you require
any further assistance, please press star zero. I
would now like to hand the conference over to
your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor
Relations. Please go ahead.
Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations:
Thank
you. Good afternoon, everyone, and
welcome to Alphabet’s first-quarter 2021 earnings
conference call. With us today are Sundar
Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now I’ll
quickly cover the Safe Harbor. Some of the
statements that we make today regarding our business,
operations, and financial performance,
including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those
areas, may be considered
forward-looking, and such statements involve a number
of risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially. For more
information, please refer to the risk factors
discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with
the SEC. During this call, we will present both
GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation
of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is
included in today's earnings press release, which
is distributed and available to the public
through our Investor Relations website located at
abc.xyz/investor. And now I’ll turn the call
over to Sundar.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google:
Thank you,
Jim, and good afternoon, everyone.
After a hard year, people in some parts of the world
are beginning to rebuild their lives,
businesses, and communities. But recovery is far from
uniform across the globe as the tragic
scenes in countries like India and Brazil remind us.
We’re continuing to help support public health officials
in their vital and urgent work. Our focus is
on providing authoritative information. We’re helping
over 100 government agencies and
non-profits worldwide distribute critical information,
and billions of PSAs, about COVID-19 and
vaccines. And Google Cloud technology is powering
a virtual agent to help make vaccination
appointments over the phone – supporting 28 languages
and dialects – for those with limited
internet access. We are focused on doing our part
to help.
In some parts of the world, the economy began to rebound,
which created a rising tide in the
first quarter that benefited a number of sectors,
including existing and emerging companies and
partners. For example, data suggest that investment
in startups is at an all time high. Our
product releases are returning to a regular cadence.
I’m particularly excited that our developer
event, Google I/O, is back this year, all-virtual
and free for everyone, on May 18th through 20th.
We’ll have significant product updates and announcements,
and I invite you all to tune in.
Today, I’ll briefly mention a few highlights from
the past quarter, and go a bit deeper on Cloud.
Then, Philipp will discuss advertising and partnership
developments. Finally, Ruth will cover the
quarterly results. Quickly turning to product highlights
of the quarter. Our knowledge and
1
information services like Search and Maps remain at the heart of our mission to provide helpful
and accurate information during important moments.
People have turned to Google Search
more than ever since the pandemic began. We see hundreds
of millions of searches every day
for COVID and related health information.
People are also searching for jobs. To help them,
job seekers can now use Search to quickly
and easily find roles that do not require a college
degree, and we’re working together with the
top employment websites to make the service even better.
Maps will be adding over 100
AI-powered improvements this year, such as Indoor
Live View, which helps you navigate
airports, transit stations and malls using augmented
reality. Last quarter I mentioned Google
News Showcase, our $1 billion investment in the news
industry. I’m pleased to see continued
momentum this quarter, with new launches in the UK,
Italy, Argentina, and Australia. In Q1, we
added more than 170 publications across 12 countries,
with more coming soon.
With respect to YouTube, people continue to find all
types of informational content, from
educational videos to podcasts. In fact, according
to a recent study conducted by Ipsos, 77% of
respondents say they used YouTube during 2020 to learn
a new skill. YouTube Shorts continues
to gain popularity, with over 6.5 billion daily views
as of March, up from 3.5 billion at the end of
2020. We’ve added a new metric to our transparency
reports, called the Violative View Rate,
which will help us estimate what percentage of views
on YouTube come from content that
violates our policies. In Q4 of last year, YouTube’s
violative view rate was between 16 and 18
views out of every 10,000. This is down over 70% compared
to the same quarter in 2017, in
large part thanks to our investments in machine learning.
Let me also mention Chrome OS, which this quarter
celebrated 10 years. It’s been a valuable
tool for millions of students and teachers during
the pandemic. According to third parties,
Chromebooks were the most popular device in K-12 education
globally for the last year.
Next, I’ll move to Cloud, where we continue to see
strong performance across both Google
Cloud Platform and Workspace. Q1 revenue grew 46%
year-over-year, with GCP’s revenue
growth rate once again meaningfully above Cloud overall.
We continue to unlock the value of
the Google ecosystem by signing multi-year, multi-product
partnerships with companies like
Global Payments and Grupo Globo. And just yesterday
we announced a new Google-wide
partnership with Univision, which is migrating to
our Cloud, continuing to distribute content on
YouTube, and reaching customers via Play and Ads.
In Cloud, there are three distinct market trends shaping
our growth and driving our product and
go-to-market strategy.
First, we see very strong customer
momentum in the Data Cloud. Our
expertise in real-time data and analytics is winning
companies like Twitter and Ingersoll Rand,
who are moving their complex data workloads to Google
Cloud. Our strength in AI and ML is
also helping Financial Services customers like HSBC,
Commerzbank, SEB Group and BBVA
improve efficiency of payments, reduce fraud and risk,
and deliver faster payment solutions.
This past quarter, we released new functionality for
BigQuery, delivering significantly better
performance for Business Intelligence queries.
Second, we’re seeing customers wanting a robust Infrastructure
Cloud in order to create
operational efficiencies and reduce IT costs. We are
winning large IT transformation deals with
companies that are migrating their data centers to
Google Cloud. Multi-cloud remains a
2
differentiator as it provides the easiest and most open development environment for customers
like Telus, allowing them to access and move their
data between various clouds.
Third, we continue to deliver helpful innovations
to enable hybrid work with Google Workspace.
This includes digital tools for front line workers
like nurses and retail store workers, as well as
new security offerings. These innovations have helped
grow our revenue per seat and the
number of seats in the last quarter. Workspace is
being adopted by customers including Keralty
in Healthcare, Sun Life in Financial Services, and
Airbus in Manufacturing & Aviation.
Now, a brief update on Other Bets. Waymo’s fully autonomous
public ride-hailing service in
Phoenix is providing hundreds of rides per week. In
San Francisco, Waymo has begun limited
employee testing. I am pleased by the progress here,
and look forward to Waymo’s continued
momentum under the leadership of new co-CEOs Tekedra
and Dmitri. Calico and its partner,
AbbVie, announced that it has entered clinical-stage
programs for new drug therapies for cancer
and neurodegenerative diseases, like ALS, Parkinson’s
disease and traumatic brain injury.
Before I close, I want to mention that in 2021, in
the U.S. alone, we plan to invest over $7 billion
in offices and data centers, and create at least 10,000
new full-time jobs. And as we do this, we
continue to make progress on our sustainability goals.
We’ve matched our operations with 100%
renewable energy for the past four years, and we are
working towards operating on carbon-free
energy, around the clock, by 2030 – a far more ambitious
goal that we hope will be
transformative for the industry.
Five of our data centers in Europe and North America
are already operating near or at 90%
carbon-free energy, around the clock. We’re also working
towards our commitment to help one
billion people make more sustainable choices with
our services by 2022. One example of how
we’re doing this is a new AI-powered feature in Maps
that will show the route with the lowest
carbon footprint when ETAs are the same. You’ll also
be able to compare the carbon impact
between routes.
Finally, as we look ahead to the rest of 2021, our
four big themes continue to guide us. First,
building and providing the most helpful products and
services. Second, continuing to earn the
trust of our users, by investing in high quality information
and keeping users’ data safe and
private. Third, strong execution as a company, particularly
as we start to re-open our offices.
And fourth, building sustainable value in our own
business and for our partners. As always,
thank you to our Googlers around the world for a great
start to the year. To everyone, I look
forward to seeing you at I/O. Over to Philipp.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
Thanks, Sundar,
and good afternoon everyone. It’s
great to be joining you again today. We’re pleased
with the strong growth in Google Services
revenues in the first quarter. Year-on-year performance
reflects elevated consumer online
activity, broad-based strength in advertiser spend,
and lapping of the initial impact of the
pandemic on advertising revenues that began in March
last year.
In the first quarter, in Search, we saw sustained
strength across most categories, led by retail.
We also saw strong performance in tech and CPG. In
YouTube, we had phenomenal growth
driven by direct response, followed by continued strength
in brand. We're seeing great
momentum in TrueView for Action ads with the number
of advertisers using the format doubling
3
over the past year. In Network, exceptional growth was driven by AdMob and Ad Manager with
particular strength in App Campaigns. Google Other
Revenues were driven by growth in
Google Play and YouTube’s non-advertising revenues,
followed by Hardware.
I would now like to take a few minutes to dive deeper
into the trends we’re seeing in our
business. As Sundar touched on earlier, the pandemic
is evolving in different ways across the
world. Some countries are in advanced stages of reopening.
Others are facing re-acceleration
of cases. And there’s everything in between. It's
never been more important to help businesses
navigate the pandemic as circumstances change.
On Travel, we’re starting to see renewed interest
from users as they turn to Google to plan their
next trip – even before they’re ready to book. Every
travel partner is looking to understand
where demand is going, and we’re helping them find
these opportunities through insights and
automation. For American Airlines, for example, that
meant using our insights tools to anticipate
demand on untapped routes – these newly prioritized
routes had a significantly higher booking
rate in Search this quarter, compared to last quarter.
Also, just last month, we made it free for hotels
and travel companies to list their booking links –
similar to what we did with Shopping last year. For
consumers, it means more choice. For
hotels and travel companies, it means free exposure
on Google. For advertisers, it means paid
campaigns can be augmented with free listings. We’re
already seeing positive results across
the board.
Let me switch gears now and talk about retail – where
we had a very strong quarter. As you
know, we’ve taken important steps over the past year
to accelerate an open retail ecosystem.
We made product listings free, removed commission
fees, and opened our shopping platform to
Shopify and PayPal. We’re also helping retailers lean
into some key opportunities. Such as
innovating in omni-channel as the line between digital
and physical retail continues to blur. And
tapping into commercial intent on YouTube and other
surfaces. Let me talk about both.
Over the last six months, people’s shopping preferences
have shifted constantly in response to
changing conditions. It’s not just online. It’s not
just offline. It’s a mix, and that’s our sweet spot
with Search, Maps and YouTube. Last quarter, we talked
about a surge in searches for
“available near me” and for “curbside pickup”. That
trend has not changed. Searches for “local”
and “businesses” are up 80% versus last year. Omni-channel
is here to stay.
Take Dick’s Sporting Goods. Throughout the pandemic,
they accelerated curbside pickup,
pick-up-in-store, and ship-from-store fulfillment
options in Search. This approach contributed to
100% year-over-year increase in e-commerce sales in
2020. And, just recently, they activated
YouTube to build awareness for new store concepts.
Michaels, the arts and crafts store, also
activated their omni-channel fulfillment approach
using Search and Maps. And to meet surging
demand for arts supplies, they used TrueView for Action
to tap into the vast number of arts and
crafts searches happening on YouTube. In 2020, their
e-commerce sales were up 350%.
We’re also doing more to help merchants tap into the
incredible innate commercial behavior
across Search and YouTube. Google Merchants can now
plug their product feeds right into their
video action campaigns. And early adopters are seeing
huge results. Luxury cosmetics
company Clarins HK added beautiful product imagery
from their Google merchant feed as an
4
extension and saw a 68% conversion rate uplift within three weeks. Any merchant can now light
this up with a single click in our Google Merchant
center.
Speaking of YouTube – we’re helping advertisers address
both brand and performance goals at
scale, driving higher return on ad spend at a time
when they need it most. We’re only a few
years in on direct response and we think there is
significant opportunity for innovation that will
improve the user experience and provide better ROI
for advertisers. On the performance side,
advertisers of all sizes are actually seeing incredible
results. Like global group fitness company,
LesMills, who was hit hard when their 20,000 partner
gyms closed during lockdown. They
accelerated digital and grew app subscribers by almost
7x with TrueView for Action.
We’re seeing strong growth in YouTube’s brand business,
fueled by a global consumer trend
from linear TV toward streaming video. With over 2
billion monthly logged in users and over a
billion hours of video watched every day, YouTube
is offering advertisers efficient reach to large
audiences which are incremental to those found on
TV. Large brands are benefiting from this
trend. Taco Bell saw 27% incremental reach for their
limited time offer campaigns, and
Kellogg’s saw incremental reach of over 30% for their
recent Special K campaign.
Before I close, I want to take a minute to highlight
our work with partners. Sundar mentioned
Google News Showcase – we now have deals with 600+
publishers across more than 12
countries. Le Monde in France, Der Spiegel and Stern
in Germany, Clarín in Argentina, Evening
Standard in the UK – just to name a few, and we’re
continuing to expand the program.
We’re also developing more valuable relationships
with some of our strategic partners. By
teaming up, we’re able to build new experiences for
our users while helping our partners
innovate and grow. We’ve gone well beyond ads to bring
the best of Google across Cloud, Play,
YouTube and more to help them do just that. Sundar
mentioned Univision. In the quarter, we
also announced T-Mobile, Albertsons, Allianz, and
Munich Re. I want to thank our customers
and partners for their collaboration – we’ve always
said, we succeed only when they succeed.
And I also want to thank our product, partnership,
sales, and support teams for their amazing
work and innovation. I’ll now hand off the call to
Ruth.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
Thank you, Philipp.
Our very strong financial results
in the first quarter reflect both lapping the impact
of COVID on our business beginning in March
2020 as well as the benefit of excellent underlying
operating performance. My focus will be on
year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter,
unless I state otherwise. I’ll start with results
at
the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and
conclude with our outlook.
For the first quarter, our Consolidated Revenues were
$55.3 billion, up 34%, or up 32% in
constant currency, reflecting elevated consumer activity
online and broad-based increases in
advertiser spending within Google Services, as well
as ongoing strength in Google Cloud. Our
total cost of revenues was $24.1 billion, up 27%,
primarily driven by Other Cost of Revenues
which was $14.4 billion, up 25%, followed by TAC,
which was $9.7 billion, up 30%. Within Other
Cost of Revenues, the biggest factors were, first
– content acquisition costs – primarily driven
by costs for YouTube’s advertising-supported content,
followed by costs for subscription
content; and second – costs associated with data centers
and other operations, offset partially
by a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes
to estimated useful lives of servers and
certain network equipment.
5
Operating expenses were $14.8 billion, up 4%. In terms
of the three component parts of opex,
first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily
by headcount growth. Second, Sales &
Marketing expenses were essentially flat, reflecting
headcount growth which was offset by
lower spend on ads and promo, as well as on travel
and entertainment. Finally, the decline in
G&A reflects the benefit of lapping the unusually
high allowances for credit losses recorded in
the first quarter of 2020 due to the impact of COVID,
offset by charges relating to certain legal
matters. Headcount was up 4,694 from the fourth quarter,
including more than 1,800 Fitbit
employees who joined us in Q1. Again, the majority
of new hires were engineers and product
managers. Operating income was $16.4 billion, up 106%
and our operating margin in the
quarter was 30%.
Other Income & Expense, was $4.8 billion, which primarily
reflects unrealized gains in the value
of investments in equity securities. Net income was
$17.9 billion. Operating Cash Flow was
$19.3 billion, with Free Cash Flow of $13.3 billion
in the quarter and $50.7 billion for the trailing
twelve months. We ended the first quarter with $135
billion in cash and marketable securities.
Let me now turn to our segment financial results.
Starting with our Google Services segment, total Google
Services Revenues were $51.2 billion,
up 34%, consisting of Google Search and other advertising
revenues of $31.9 billion in the
quarter, up 30%, with strength across most categories,
led by retail. YouTube advertising
revenues of $6.0 billion, up 49%, driven by exceptional
performance in direct response and
ongoing strength in brand advertising. Network advertising
revenues of $6.8 billion, up 30%,
driven by AdMob and Ad Manager.
Other Revenues were $6.5 billion, up 46%, primarily
driven by growth in Play and YouTube
non-advertising revenues, followed by Hardware, which
benefited from the addition of Fitbit
revenues. Google Services operating income was $19.5
billion, up 69%, and the operating
margin was 38%.
Turning to the Google Cloud segment, including GCP
and Google Workspace. Revenues were
$4.0 billion for the first quarter, up 46%. GCP’s
revenue growth was again meaningfully above
Cloud overall. Strong growth in Google Workspace revenues
was driven by growth in both
seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had
an operating loss of $1.0 billion. As to
our Other Bets, in the first quarter revenues were
$198 million. The operating loss was $1.1
billion. Let me end with our outlook for each segment
and our investments more broadly.
For Google Services, for the remainder of 2021, year-over-year
comparisons will be affected
meaningfully by the impact of COVID last year – with
a greater benefit in Q2 from an easier
comp relative to what you saw in Q1, and then beginning
to lap stronger performance in the
second half of the year. In the first quarter, we
continued to benefit from elevated consumer
online activity and broad-based strength in advertiser
spend. It is too early to say how durable
this consumer behavior will be as economies recover
and restrictions on mobility are lifted.
Within Other Revenues, Play benefited from an increased
level of user engagement starting in
Q1 last year due to the pandemic, which we are now
beginning to lap. In terms of investment
levels within Google Services, we still intend to
invest aggressively to support the extraordinary
opportunities we see. That being said, in some areas
like travel and entertainment and
6
marketing events, the pace of investment through the balance of the year may be affected by
the pace of COVID recovery globally.
As for Google Cloud, our approach to building the
business has not changed. We remain
focused on revenue growth, and we will continue to
invest aggressively in products and our
go-to-market organization given the opportunity we
see. The operating results in Q1 in part
reflect some notable items in the quarter, first,
the lapping of the unusually high allowances for
credit losses recorded in the first quarter of 2020
as I already mentioned; and second, lower
depreciation expense due to the change in estimated
useful lives, although the dollar benefit
will diminish throughout the course of the year across
segments. As we have noted previously,
operating results should benefit from increased scale
over time; however, at this point we do
remain focused on continuing to invest to build the
Cloud organization for long-term
performance.
In terms of Other Bets, we continue to invest with
a focus on the long-term value creation
opportunity. Turning to CapEx at the consolidated
level, the results reflect ongoing investment in
our technical infrastructure, offset by a slower pace
of investment in office facilities given the
ongoing impact of COVID. Within technical infrastructure,
servers continue to be the largest
driver of investment, as we continue to invest to
support Cloud, Search, Ads and Machine
Learning.
Finally, with respect to capital allocation, our primary
use of capital continues to be to support
organic growth in our businesses, followed by retaining
flexibility for acquisitions and
investments. We complement these growth drivers with
a return of capital. As we indicated in
our press release today, our board has authorized
the repurchase of up to an additional $50
billion of our Class C Stock. Thank you. And now Sundar,
Philipp and I will take your questions.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. As a reminder, to ask
a question, you will need to press star
one on your telephone. To withdraw your question,
please press the pound key. And to prevent
any background noise, we ask that you please mute
your line once your question has been
stated. And our first question comes from the line
of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your
line is now open.
Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):
Thanks for taking my
questions. I have two. First one for
Sundar. Appreciate the color on the four key priorities.
I wanted to dig a little more into the “build
and provide the most helpful products and services.”
Maybe if you can sort of talk to us about
Search. How do you think about the key investment
priorities and innovation areas to continue
to make Search more and more helpful for your users
and your advertisers? And the second
one for Philipp maybe. Similar question on YouTube.
You've done such a great job on
innovation around YouTube. Where do you see the largest
incremental opportunities for further
innovation at YouTube to deliver more outsized value
for your advertisers? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google:
Thanks. On
Search, great question. I still think we
are in very early stages. A recent example which I
was proud of was when the ship was stuck in
the Suez Canal and then it got out. If you asked a
question to Google, I think very soon after
that we had the right answer. It seems obvious to
do, except we need to provide right answers
and without giving wrong answers or misinformation
for many other things. So to do that is
where all our underlying investments go, and that's
how we think about it over the long-term.
7
BERT last year, I think, was a great example of it.
It was one of our biggest quality
improvements. And that was based on the Transformer
breakthrough from our Google AI team
which laid the foundation for it. So we are continuing
to invest that way – in the deep
technology. As the web is scaling up, there's more
information than ever before. So that's a big
part of what we are doing. Beyond that, there's a
lot of opportunity to improve the user
experience. You've seen our efforts around Shopping.
That's one aspect of how we are working
hard to improve the experience there so – but we are
looking at it pretty deeply. Philipp?
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
Yes. On the
YouTube side, let me start with our
direct response business. Growth was truly exceptional
this quarter. DR was practically
nonexistent on YouTube a few years ago, and it's now
a large and fast-growing business. And
we're just getting started, in my view. People already,
as you know, go to YouTube to decide
what they want to buy. And we want to make it easier
for them to buy and make the discovery
process overall a lot easier. And for creators, we
launched new shoppable capabilities so
viewers can actually make purchases from their favorite
creators directly on YouTube.
Just as an example, as part of our BrandConnect program,
Calvin Klein tested these and drove
over – I think it was – 200% lift in brand search
and sold out multiple products actually. For
merchants, they can now bring their product feeds
directly into their video campaigns. And I
think we're still scratching the surface on what's
possible really with commercial intent on
YouTube. And then there's, of course, the opportunity
to be a major platform for brands.
Historical approaches to reaching audiences through,
let's just say, call it, linear TV don't really
work anymore. Advertisers are using YouTube now to
reach the audiences they can't find
anywhere else. And remember, more 18-to-49-year-olds
are actually watching YouTube than all
linear TV combined. And brands are also seeing more
incremental reach on YouTube
compared to TV.
So we're starting to see advertisers buy a mix, actually,
of awareness and more action-oriented
formats. And they are driving reach and results across
the funnel from awareness to
consideration to action. So we see a lot of really
interesting opportunities here.
Brian Nowak (Morgan Stanley):
Great. Thank you, both.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question
comes from Doug Anmuth from JP
Morgan. Your line is now open.
Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan):
Thanks for taking the questions.
I have two. First, Ruth, just
wanted to ask you about Cloud. You saw some significant
benefits just from the change in
useful life. But I think in the past, you talked about
1Q perhaps being the biggest loss of the
year. I was just curious if that's still the case,
in your view, going forward. And then second, just
given the management transition that we've seen at
Waymo, should we expect any change in
terms of how things are operated there going forward?
Thank you.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
Thanks for the
question. So in terms of Cloud and
overall performance – I think, the main point I would
say is, I wouldn't extrapolate generally from
quarter to quarter, given we're still in the early
stages of building the business. We do intend to
continue to invest meaningfully in Cloud, given the
opportunity. And so, as you said, there were
8
a couple of things that benefited margins in the quarter, both the depreciation expense item, but
also lapping the unusually high allowance for credit
losses that were recorded back in the first
quarter.
So the main takeaway is we're continuing to invest.
We'll invest aggressively in products and
go-to-market, what we’ve talked about quite consistently
over time. And as much as operating
losses and operating margin will benefit from increased
scale over time, at this point, we do
remain focused on investing to build the organization
for long-term performance.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google:
And, Doug,
on Waymo, John is stepping down as
CEO. And he's been planning for this transition, and
Dmitri and Tekedra have been working
closely with him. And so we'll continue our investments
there. Pretty excited that the fully
autonomous experience of Waymo One is available in
Phoenix, and we are also accelerating
the development of our next-generation Waymo Driver
to deploy it in San Francisco. And this
past quarter, Waymo began limited rider testing in
San Francisco. And so really focused on
making sure we make the hard technical progress so
that we can operationalize this. And so we
will continue executing towards that.
Doug Anmuth (JP Morgan):
Okay. Thank you, both.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question
comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies.
Your line is now open.
Brent Thill (Jefferies):
Thanks. As it relates to
some of the harder-hit industries, I'm curious if
you could just characterize the shape of the recovery,
what you're seeing across travel and
some of the other sectors. And have there been any
verticals that you have yet to see recover
that may pull out in the second half of the year?
Thank you.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
So overall, what
we indicated is that the strong
results reflect, in part, lapping the impact that
we saw starting late in Q1 of last year and then a
pickup in a number of areas. I think the main thing
we'd want to leave you with is that we are
seeing, in part, an acceleration in the shift to digital.
But it's too early to forecast the extent to
which these changes in consumer behavior and advertising
spend will endure. There's some
obvious examples. If you think about, for example,
the bump in consumption for things like
outfitting your home to work from home, obviously,
that doesn't repeat. And so our main thing is
we think it's premature at this point to really assess
how durable those consumer behavior
trends are.
Brent Thill (Jefferies):
In travel specifically, can
you just give us any color in terms of what
you're seeing on that front?
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
Nothing more
to add. Philipp had a couple of
comments about some of the areas where we're trying
to innovate to be helpful to our partners.
But beyond that, nothing to add.
Brent Thill (Jefferies):
Great. Thank you.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question
comes from Justin Post from Bank of
9
America. Your line is now open.
Justin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):
Maybe
one for Philipp and one for Ruth. First,
Philipp, you've mentioned a couple times the durability
of the improvement is tough to gauge.
Maybe you could help us understand what the key drivers
of Search are that you're thinking
about over the next couple years. Is it queries? Product
improvements? Certain changes in
verticals like Shopping? How are you thinking about
driving Search growth? And then maybe
for Ruth, models showed great efficiency last year
on the cost side and margins. Anything
you're learning or experiences during the pandemic
that we can think about post-pandemic on
cost efficiencies or things like that? Thank you.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
Yes, thank
you. Thank you so much for the
question. I usually look at the different components
of Search as basically four key drivers. The
first one, obviously, being the queries. So are we
really the best place for users to turn to when
they need information? The second one is, I would
call it, ads coverage. So what percent of
queries is really commercial and then what percentage
are we actually covering with ads? And
then we need to ask ourselves, do both of these have
upside?
The third one is click-through rates. Are individual
ad click-through rates close to being
optimized? Is there more we can do here by just delivering
better creatives, better ads, better
answers? To what extent can we deploy next-generation
machine learning here? And then the
last one is obviously the CPC, right? How much is
someone willing to bid for a click on their ad?
And this is obviously to a large extent driven by
the quality of traffic we're sending. And then
conversion rate is a big driver of this. So working
very closely with our partners, advertisers and
so on across the world to help them optimize their
conversion rates and their ROI. Those are
really the four big components, and I'm excited about
all four of them actually.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
And in terms
of your question on efficiency, I
appreciate the question. I think at the highest level,
the approach is unchanged. Our approach
on investing and capital allocation is, first and
foremost, to support long-term growth with
financially sustainable businesses. It's about being
sharper within product areas and then
making sure we're investing in what I keep referring
to as operational excellence, things like our
technical infrastructure, systems to improve productivity,
to improve velocity of our product
teams and then the very important efforts around privacy
and security and content moderation.
And I think, to your question, the experiences of
this past year underscored, really, the value of
having made those investments to protect and support
operational excellence. It really served
us well, and customers, in our ability to deliver
throughout this period of time. So that framework
is unaltered. I think that part of what you're seeing
in the first quarter – I've said it a couple times
now, but are some notable items in the quarter. The
lapping of the allowance for credit losses,
the benefit from depreciation life. And then there
were certain things that were due to COVID –
just the lower impact for things like T&E and marketing.
And so the main point is we will continue to invest
for long-term growth. I've said that in both
areas, Google Services and Cloud. And we have continued
to maintain that framework that you
referenced about looking for efficiencies where they
are but ensuring that we can deliver for
users and customers.

Justin Post (Bank of America Merrill Lynch):
Great. Thank you.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question
comes from Colin Sebastian from
Baird. Your line is now open.
Colin Sebastian (Baird):
Great. Thanks. Good afternoon.
Sundar, first, you've highlighted for
years that machine learning is clearly a strength
and differentiation of the overall platform,
including in Cloud services, where we're also seeing
competitors focus more on their
capabilities here. So I'm wondering if you can talk
about the pace of change around data
science and how Google can sustain its competitive
advantage in those areas. And then,
Philipp, I wanted to follow up on the momentum in
Search that you attribute to Google
Shopping. Is it fair to say that the shift to free
product listings has led to the desired increase
in
retail advertising across the platform, or are there
other reasons beyond the pandemic that you
attribute for that success? Thanks.
Sundar Pichai, CEO Alphabet and Google:
Colin, thanks.
And, obviously, as we are thinking
about AI, it all starts with foundational R&D we do.
I think we are one of the largest R&D
investors in AI in the world. And so thinking ahead
and doing that, and we're doing it across all
the foundational areas. And we are taking many diverse
approaches. So as we make
breakthroughs – I earlier spoke about Transformers
and how that translated as BERT to
improve search quality.
And similarly, we are very committed to taking the
AI improvements and bringing it through our
GCP offerings to our enterprise customers as well.
So it's an approach we are deeply
committed to. And we're thinking at it with all layers
of the stack. So this is why you see us work
hard on TPUs and we think about the toolchain for
developers on top of all that. And so – and I
think when I look at the progress ahead, I think there's
a lot more progress coming down the
pipe, and so I'm pretty excited. And it's why I feel
Google – GCP will be differentiated over time
as our competitive advantage plays out here.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
Yes. And on
the Shopping side, look, it's been a
year since we brought Bill on board, Bill Ready, and
we pivoted our Shopping strategy to better
support retailers and consumers, trying to really
build an open retail ecosystem. And we're
pleased with the progress we're making. As you said,
free listings and zero commissions have
actually lowered barriers for online retail.
Shopping Ads continue to be a powerful way for resellers
to promote their products, and the
combination of free and paid is a meaningful one.
We had a set of new partnerships with
Shopify and PayPal that are giving retailers a lot
more choice. And we will continue to simplify
the, let me call it, end-to-end user and merchant
experience, of course. In particular, we are
trying to streamline and working hard to streamline
the backend experience for merchants,
especially for hybrid retailers, so retailers that
play in both brick-and-mortar and in digital. And
overall, we want to make it much, much easier for
retailers to get started on Google and have
their information appear across surfaces. And I mentioned
the overall strength in retail before.
So thank you.
Colin Sebastian (Baird):
Thanks, guys.

Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from ISI.
Your line is now open.
Mark Mahaney (Evercore ISI):
Thanks. I wanted to ask
about your attempts to retain
advertisers. And I ask it this way. I think we've
had record numbers of new business formations
in the country and around the world on the unfortunate
impact of COVID. But I think that's – my
guess is it's been a huge tailwind for your business.
At the same time, we've had this real
tipover, I think, of linear TV ad budgets in the back
half of the year to online channels like
YouTube. So talk about these new advertisers that
you've brought onto the Google platform,
what you've been able to do, how confident you are
in your ability to retain them, your
advertiser retention strategy. Thanks a lot.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
So I can take
this. I mean, a lot of the new
advertisers that you're referring to are obviously
SMBs. And there's no doubt that this has been
a challenging year for SMBs. The pandemic has disrupted
how many of them connect with their
customers. But, frankly, the pandemic has also been
a catalyst for key consumer trends,
obviously creating a lot of new opportunities for
small businesses. And obviously consumers
are spending more time online. They're buying more
online. They were willing to try new
brands. And they're eager to support local businesses,
SMBs.
So searches for "support local businesses" are up
significantly since last year. And we've been
focused, really, on helping SMBs with simpler tools
so they can actually embrace digital a lot
faster. And that's where we have really invested over
the year – making everything simpler. We
had a very wide range of solutions to help them get
online, get discovered across all of our key
products – Search, Maps, YouTube and so on. And there's
multiple, multiple fascinating stories
from them coming back to us. And we see this positively
reflected in our rates here as well.
Mark Mahaney (Evercore ISI):
Okay. Thank you, Philipp.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our next question
comes from Michael Nathanson from
MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.
Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson):
Thank you. I
have two, one for Philipp, one for Ruth.
Philipp, on the questions on Search, when we step
back, which categories, which geographies
do you think you're still underrepresented as a percentage
of marketing spending – where we
could see potentially even more lift to come? And
then to Ruth, we always asked in the past
about capex spending – we know the change in useful
life. But I wonder, has this pandemic
changed maybe your approach to the office space that
you bought and thinking about how the
company's going to deploy capital in terms of space
going forward and how you think about the
future of capex in the next couple years based on
post-pandemic?
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
Philipp seems
to be on mute. I'll go ahead and start
on the capex question.
Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson):
Okay. Okay.
Thanks, Ruth.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
So in terms of
capex, I think – I'll address two parts.
You asked about office facilities, but I do think
it's important to note, we are continuing to invest
12
in our technical infrastructure, and that's what you saw again here this quarter, and we'll
continue to do so to support growth that we're seeing
in Cloud and Search and Ads and
Machine Learning. No change there so you'll be seeing
that, but the core of your question was
really about office facilities.
And I think it's – we've been very clear we do value
bringing people together in the office. And
we're looking at a hybrid work from home, work from
office model. As we look forward at
developing our real estate footprint for offices,
what we factor into it is, first, we are growing our
headcount. We are looking at less density per employee.
So even with a hybrid work
environment, we will continue to need space. And so
we're continuing to build out our
campuses and office facilities.
What you saw in the first quarter was a slightly slower
pace of that and a slower pace on fit outs
as well as we're evolving what does this space look
like. But we expect to continue to pick up
the pace there as we fit out our spaces for this kind
of new, reimagined environment. So, yes,
we'll continue to be investing in campuses around
the globe as we have been.
Philipp Schindler, SVP and CBO, Google:
Yes. And on
your first part of your question, look,
we're looking at our business from a very global perspective
and are excited about it. Keep in
mind, we're not just addressing above the line marketing
budgets from an addressable market
perspective. So not just traditional advertising,
TV advertising and so on. Below the line budgets
are really significant, everything – promotional pricing,
product placement, sponsorships and so
on and so on.
So there's this massive acceleration in e-commerce
due to the pandemic. Still, more than 80%
of commerce is still offline, so there's a huge opportunity
here across the world for us to tap
into – into those other budgets. They were really
traditionally used in a very different context. So
there's plenty of room for growth here. And I talked
about how we look at it from a queries
perspective, from a commercial intent perspective.
We're trying to use machine learning really
smartly here. But the real focus in the end has to
be how do we actually make our partners
successful, how do we drive incremental ROI for them?
And as long as we continue this, well, I
think we should continue to see budgets move our way
as well.
Michael Nathanson (MoffettNathanson):
Thank you.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And our final question
comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald
from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Brian Fitzgerald (Wells Fargo):
Hey, guys, you mentioned
the strength in the supply-side
products in the Network business. Wondering if you
might be able to comment on how the
demand-side products are doing? And maybe in a similar
vein, some of the changes you've
made in ad technology over the last few years may
have had the effect of drawing some of your
advertiser customers more deeply into your tech stack.
Wondering if this is also creating a
strong onramp in GCP specifically around data analytics
products like BigQuery? Thanks.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
So in terms of
overall on Network revenues, as I
think I noted briefly in opening comments, what we're
really seeing is the ongoing strength in
advertiser spend. Both Philipp and I talked about
that. Particularly what we saw was AdMob
13
and Ad Manager and particular strength in App Campaigns. And all of this just underscores
what each of us commented on, that the results do
reflect what was broad-based strength
across our partners' properties in the first quarter.
Brian Fitzgerald (Wells Fargo):
Thanks, Ruth.
Ruth Porat, CFO Alphabet and Google:
Thank you.
Candice (Operator):
Thank you. And that concludes
our question-and-answer session. I’d like
to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland
for any closing remarks.
Jim Friedland, Director Investor Relations:
Thanks,
everyone, for joining us today. We look
forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter
2021 call. Thank you and have a
good evening.
Candice (Operator):
This concludes today's conference
call. Thank you for participating, and
you may now disconnect.
