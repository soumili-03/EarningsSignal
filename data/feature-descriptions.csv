Feature,Description,Interpretation
avg_evasiveness,"Averagfe predicted evasiveness score from a language model or classifier trained to detect evasive or non-informative language. Typically derived from model outputs using fine-tuned embeddings or supervised labels on evasive responses.","High values suggest the speaker frequently avoids direct answers, providing vague or deflective language. Low values indicate direct, transparent, and information-rich responses."
avg_sentiment,"Mean sentiment score of the speaker’s utterances, usually derived from sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or transformer-based sentiment models). Ranges from negative to positive sentiment.","High positive sentiment can signal optimism or spin; extremely high may indicate artificial positivity to mask bad news. Low or negative values may indicate realism or stress; moderate levels suggest balance."
avg_readability_kincaid,"Average Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level across utterances, computed from sentence length and syllables per word. Higher scores correspond to higher grade-level difficulty.","High values indicate more complex, harder-to-read language, possibly signaling obfuscation. Low values indicate simpler, more accessible explanations, often associated with clarity."
avg_readability_ease,"Average Flesch Reading Ease score. Computed as 206.835 - (1.015 × words/sentence) - (84.6 × syllables/word).","High values (easier text) suggest straightforward explanations; low values (harder text) can indicate dense or jargon-heavy speech, potentially linked to evasive or technical deflection."
avg_QA_similarity,"Average semantic similarity between analyst questions and management responses, computed via cosine similarity of sentence embeddings (e.g., SBERT).","High similarity indicates that answers directly address the questions. Low similarity implies evasive or off-topic responses, characteristic of deflection or avoidance."
avg_answer_length,"Mean length (in words) of management answers to analyst questions.","Short answers may suggest avoidance or lack of elaboration. Very long answers may reflect overcompensation, verbosity, or filibustering; moderate lengths indicate balanced engagement."
avg_numeric_density,"Proportion of numerical expressions (e.g., percentages, quantities, financial figures) relative to total words.","High numeric density suggests data-driven, concrete responses. Low density indicates qualitative or vague language, potentially a sign of evasion or lack of transparency."
avg_lm_sentiment,"Average sentiment derived from a large language model’s contextual sentiment analysis (captures subtle tone and intent).","High values may reflect overly positive or promotional tone (potential masking). Low or neutral values may indicate objectivity and honesty."
avg_lexical_diversity,"Ratio    of unique words to total words (type-token ratio). Measures vocabulary variety.","High diversity indicates richer language and possibly avoidance of repetitive talking points. Low diversity may signal scripted or rehearsed answers, which can accompany evasiveness."
avg_complex_word_ratio,"Proportion of words with three or more syllables relative to total words. Measures linguistic complexity.","High values suggest complex, potentially obfuscating language. Low values reflect simpler, direct speech, often easier to interpret and less evasive."
avg_hedge_to_modal_ratio,"Ratio of hedging terms (e.g., 'maybe', 'perhaps', 'sort of') to modal verbs (e.g., 'will', 'must', 'should').","High ratio indicates uncertainty or reluctance to commit, a common sign of evasiveness. Low ratio suggests confidence and decisiveness in statements."
avg_dale_chall_score,"Average Dale–Chall readability score, which compares word difficulty using a familiar-word list and sentence length.","High scores indicate complex, jargon-filled or less familiar language (potential obfuscation). Low scores indicate more transparent and accessible communication."
n_questions,"Total number of analyst questions addressed in the transcript or segment.","A larger number may dilute depth per answer; fewer but detailed questions might improve clarity. Useful as a control variable in evasiveness modeling."
avg_sentiment_polarity,"Mean sentiment polarity value, often computed from lexicon-based models; measures emotional tone from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).","High positive polarity could signal over-optimism or corporate spin; low polarity may indicate transparency or acknowledgment of risk."
avg_modal_ratio_verbs,"Ratio of modal verbs (e.g., 'might', 'could', 'would') to total verbs in management speech.","High ratio indicates cautious or speculative language, often used when avoiding commitment. Low ratio reflects assertive, confident communication."
avg_coleman_liau_index,"Average Coleman–Liau Index score, based on characters per word and words per sentence; indicates textual complexity.","High values imply more complex, technical speech that may obscure meaning. Low values indicate accessible, plain language associated with transparency."
